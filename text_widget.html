        <h1 id="conceptual-overview">Conceptual Overview</h1>
<p>GTK+ has an extremely powerful framework for multiline text editing. The
primary objects involved in the process are #GtkTextBuffer, which
represents the text being edited, and #GtkTextView, a widget which can
display a #GtkTextBuffer. Each buffer can be displayed by any number of
views.</p>
<p>One of the important things to remember about text in GTK+ is that it's
in the UTF-8 encoding. This means that one character can be encoded as
multiple bytes. Character counts are usually referred to as offsets,
while byte counts are called indexes. If you confuse these two, things
will work fine with ASCII, but as soon as your buffer contains multibyte
characters, bad things will happen.</p>
<p>Text in a buffer can be marked with tags. A tag is an attribute that can
be applied to some range of text. For example, a tag might be called
"bold" and make the text inside the tag bold. However, the tag concept
is more general than that; tags don't have to affect appearance. They
can instead affect the behavior of mouse and key presses, "lock" a range
of text so the user can't edit it, or countless other things. A tag is
represented by a #GtkTextTag object. One #GtkTextTag can be applied to
any number of text ranges in any number of buffers.</p>
<p>Each tag is stored in a #GtkTextTagTable. A tag table defines a set of
tags that can be used together. Each buffer has one tag table associated
with it; only tags from that tag table can be used with the buffer. A
single tag table can be shared between multiple buffers, however.</p>
<p>Tags can have names, which is convenient sometimes (for example, you can
name your tag that makes things bold "bold"), but they can also be
anonymous (which is convenient if you're creating tags on-the-fly).</p>
<p>Most text manipulation is accomplished with iterators, represented by a
#GtkTextIter. An iterator represents a position between two characters
in the text buffer. #GtkTextIter is a struct designed to be allocated
on the stack; it's guaranteed to be copiable by value and never contain
any heap-allocated data. Iterators are not valid indefinitely; whenever
the buffer is modified in a way that affects the number of characters in
the buffer, all outstanding iterators become invalid. (Note that
deleting 5 characters and then reinserting 5 still invalidates
iterators, though you end up with the same number of characters you pass
through a state with a different number).</p>
<p>Because of this, iterators can't be used to preserve positions across
buffer modifications. To preserve a position, the #GtkTextMark object
is ideal. You can think of a mark as an invisible cursor or insertion
point; it floats in the buffer, saving a position. If the text
surrounding the mark is deleted, the mark remains in the position the
text once occupied; if text is inserted at the mark, the mark ends up
either to the left or to the right of the new text, depending on its
gravity. The standard text cursor in left-to-right languages is a mark
with right gravity, because it stays to the right of inserted text.</p>
<p>Like tags, marks can be either named or anonymous. There are two marks
built-in to #GtkTextBuffer; these are named <code>"insert"</code> and
<code>"selection_bound"</code> and refer to the insertion point and the boundary of
the selection which is not the insertion point, respectively. If no text
is selected, these two marks will be in the same position. You can
manipulate what is selected and where the cursor appears by moving these
marks around. [1]</p>
<p>Text buffers always contain at least one line, but may be empty (that
is, buffers can contain zero characters). The last line in the text
buffer never ends in a line separator (such as newline); the other lines
in the buffer always end in a line separator. Line separators count as
characters when computing character counts and character offsets. Note
that some Unicode line separators are represented with multiple bytes in
UTF-8, and the two-character sequence "\r\n" is also considered a line
separator.</p>
<h1 id="simple-example">Simple Example</h1>
<p>The simplest usage of #GtkTextView might look like this:</p>
<pre><code>  GtkWidget *view;
  GtkTextBuffer *buffer;

  view = gtk_text_view_new ();

  buffer = gtk_text_view_get_buffer (GTK_TEXT_VIEW (view));

  gtk_text_buffer_set_text (buffer, "Hello, this is some text", -1);

  /* Now you might put the view in a container and display it on the
   * screen; when the user edits the text, signals on the buffer
   * will be emitted, such as "changed", "insert_text", and so on.
   */
</code></pre>
<p>In many cases it's also convenient to first create the buffer with
gtk_text_buffer_new(), then create a widget for that buffer with
gtk_text_view_new_with_buffer(). Or you can change the buffer the
widget displays after the widget is created with
gtk_text_view_set_buffer().</p>
<h1 id="example-of-changing-text-attributes">Example of Changing Text Attributes</h1>
<p>The way to affect text attributes in #GtkTextView is to apply tags that
change the attributes for a region of text. For text features that come
from the theme — such as font and foreground color — use CSS to override
their default values.</p>
<pre><code>  GtkWidget *view;
  GtkTextBuffer *buffer;
  GtkTextIter start, end;
  PangoFontDescription *font_desc;
  GdkRGBA rgba;
  GtkTextTag *tag;
  GtkCssProvider *provider;
  GtkStyleContext *context;

  view = gtk_text_view_new ();

  buffer = gtk_text_view_get_buffer (GTK_TEXT_VIEW (view));

  gtk_text_buffer_set_text (buffer, "Hello, this is some text", -1);

  /* Change default font and color throughout the widget */
  provider = gtk_css_provider_new ();
  gtk_css_provider_load_from_data (provider,
                                   "textview {"
                                   " font: 15 serif;"
                                   "  color: green;"
                                   "}",
                                   -1);
  context = gtk_widget_get_style_context (view);
  gtk_style_context_add_provider (context,
                                  GTK_STYLE_PROVIDER (provider),
                                  GTK_STYLE_PROVIDER_PRIORITY_APPLICATION);

  /* Change left margin throughout the widget */
  gtk_text_view_set_left_margin (GTK_TEXT_VIEW (view), 30);

  /* Use a tag to change the color for just one part of the widget */
  tag = gtk_text_buffer_create_tag (buffer, "blue_foreground",
                        "foreground", "blue", NULL);  
  gtk_text_buffer_get_iter_at_offset (buffer, &amp;start, 7);
  gtk_text_buffer_get_iter_at_offset (buffer, &amp;end, 12);
  gtk_text_buffer_apply_tag (buffer, tag, &amp;start, &amp;end);
</code></pre>
<p>The gtk-demo application that comes with GTK+ contains more example code
for #GtkTextView.</p>
<ol>
<li>If you want to place the cursor in response to a user action, be
sure to use gtk_text_buffer_place_cursor(), which moves both at
once without causing a temporary selection (moving one then the
other temporarily selects the range in between the old and new
positions).</li>
