If the accelerator map doesn t yet contain an entry for accel_path a new one is created. \nLocking an accelerator path prevents its accelerator from being changed during runtime. A locked accelerator path can be unlocked by gtk_accel_map_unlock_path. Refer to gtk_accel_map_change_entry for information about runtime accelerator changes. \nIf called more than once accel_path remains locked until gtk_accel_map_unlock_path has been called an equivalent number of times. \nNote that locking of individual accelerator paths is independent from locking the GtkAccelGroup containing them. For runtime accelerator changes to be possible both the accelerator path and its GtkAccelGroup have to be unlocked. \nParameters \na valid accelerator path \nSince \nLocks the given accelerator path.
