Useful if you want to line up the text in an entry with some other text e.g. when using the entry to implement editable cells in a sheet widget. \nAlso useful to convert mouse events into coordinates inside the Pango.Layout e.g. to take some action if some part of the entry text is clicked. \nNote that as the user scrolls around in the entry the offsets will change you ll need to connect to the notify scroll offset signal to track this. Remember when using the Pango.Layout functions you need to convert to and from pixels using PANGO_PIXELS not introspectable or Pango.Constants.SCALE. \nKeep in mind that the layout text may contain a preedit string so Gtk.Entry.LayoutIndexToTextIndex and Gtk.Entry.TextIndexToLayoutIndex are needed to convert byte indices in the layout to byte indices in the entry contents. \nParameters \nlocation to store X offset of layout or null \nlocation to store Y offset of layout or null \n"});
