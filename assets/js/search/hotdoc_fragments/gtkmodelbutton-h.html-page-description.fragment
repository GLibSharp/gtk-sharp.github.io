In contrast to GtkToggleButton or GtkRadioButton which can also be backed by a GAction via the GtkActionable action name property GtkModelButton will adapt its appearance according to the kind of action it is backed by and appear either as a plain check or radio button. \nModel buttons are used when popovers from a menu model with gtk_popover_new_from_model they can also be used manually in a GtkPopoverMenu. \nWhen the action is specified via the GtkActionable action name and GtkActionable action target properties the role of the button i.e. whether it is a plain check or radio button is determined by the type of the action and doesn t have to be explicitly specified with the GtkModelButton role property. \nThe content of the button is specified by the GtkModelButton text and GtkModelButton icon properties. \nThe appearance of model buttons can be influenced with the GtkModelButton centered and GtkModelButton iconic properties. \nModel buttons have built in support for submenus in GtkPopoverMenu. To make a GtkModelButton that opens a submenu when activated set the GtkModelButton menu name property. To make a button that goes back to the parent menu you should set the GtkModelButton inverted property to place the submenu indicator at the opposite side. \nGtkModelButton has a main CSS node with name modelbutton and a subnode which will have the name check radio or arrow depending on the role of the button and whether it has a menu name set. \nThe subnode is positioned before or after the content nodes and gets the left or right style class depending on where it is located. \nIconic model buttons see GtkModelButton iconic change the name of their main node to button and add a model style class to it. The indicator subnode is invisible in this case. \n"});
