fragment_downloaded_cb({"url": "gtkentrycompletion.html#page-description", "fragment": "GtkEntryCompletion is an auxiliary object to be used in conjunction with GtkEntry to provide the completion functionality. It implements the GtkCellLayout interface to allow the user to add extra cells to the GtkTreeView with completion matches. \nCompletion functionality means that when the user modifies the text in the entry GtkEntryCompletion checks which rows in the model match the current content of the entry and displays a list of matches. By default the matching is done by comparing the entry text case insensitively against the text column of the model see gtk_entry_completion_set_text_column but this can be overridden with a custom match function see gtk_entry_completion_set_match_func \nWhen the user selects a completion the content of the entry is updated. By default the content of the entry is replaced by the text column of the model but this can be overridden by connecting to the match selected signal and updating the entry in the signal handler. Note that you should return TRUE from the signal handler to suppress the default behaviour. \nTo add completion functionality to an entry use gtk_entry_set_completion. \nIn addition to regular completion matches which will be inserted into the entry when they are selected GtkEntryCompletion also allows to display actions in the popup window. Their appearance is similar to menuitems to differentiate them clearly from completion strings. When an action is selected the action activated signal is emitted. \nGtkEntryCompletion uses a GtkTreeModelFilter model to represent the subset of the entire model that is currently matching. While the GtkEntryCompletion signals match selected and cursor on match take the original model and an iter pointing to that model as arguments other callbacks and signals such as GtkCellLayoutDataFunc or apply attributes will generally take the filter model as argument. As long as you are only calling gtk_tree_model_get this will make no difference to you. If for some reason you need the original model use gtk_tree_model_filter_get_model. Don t forget to use gtk_tree_model_filter_convert_iter_to_child_iter to obtain a matching iter. \n"});
