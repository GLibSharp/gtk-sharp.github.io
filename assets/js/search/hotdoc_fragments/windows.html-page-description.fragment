When compiling GTK on Windows this backend is the default. \nThe Windows GDK backend can be influenced with some additional command line arguments. \nsync. \nDon t batch GDI requests. This might be a marginally useful option for debugging. \nno wintab ignore wintab. \nDon t use the Wintab API for tablet support. \nuse wintab. \nUse the Wintab API for tablet support. This is the default. \nmax colors number. \nIn color mode restrict the size of the color palette to the specified number of colors. This option is obsolete. \nThe Win32 GDK backend can be influenced with some additional environment variables. \nGDK_IGNORE_WINTAB. \nIf this variable is set GTK doesn t use the Wintab API for tablet support. \nGDK_USE_WINTAB. \nIf this variable is set GTK uses the Wintab API for tablet support. This is the default. \nGDK_WIN32_MAX_COLORS. \nSpecifies the size of the color palette used in color mode. \nBy default the system cursor theme is used. This makes GTK prefer cursors that Windows currently uses falling back to Adwaita cursors and as the last resort built in X cursors. \nWhen any other cursor theme is used GTK will prefer cursors from that theme falling back to Windows cursors and built in X cursors. \nTheme can be changed by setting gtk cursor theme name GTK setting. Users can override GTK settings in the settings.ini file or at runtime in the GTK Inspector. \nThemes are loaded from normal Windows variants of the XDG locations HOME icons THEME cursors APPDATA icons THEME cursors RUNTIME_PREFIX share icons THEME cursors. \nThe gtk cursor theme size setting is ignored GTK will use the cursor size that Windows tells it to use. \nMore information about GTK on Windows including detailed build instructions binary downloads etc can be found online. \n"});
