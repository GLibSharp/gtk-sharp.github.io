By default the chooser presents a predefined palette of colors plus a small number of settable custom colors. It is also possible to select a different color with the single color editor. To enter the single color editing mode use the context menu of any color of the palette or use the button to add a new custom color. \nThe chooser automatically remembers the last selection as well as custom colors. \nTo change the initially selected color use gtk_color_chooser_set_rgba. To get the selected color use gtk_color_chooser_get_rgba. \nThe GtkColorChooserWidget is used in the GtkColorChooserDialog to provide a dialog for selecting colors. \nGtkColorChooserWidget has a single CSS node with name colorchooser. \n"});
