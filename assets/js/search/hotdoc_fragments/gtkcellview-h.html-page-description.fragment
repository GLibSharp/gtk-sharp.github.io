A GtkCellAreaContext can be provided to the GtkCellView at construction time in order to keep the cellview in context of a group of cell views this ensures that the renderers displayed will be properly aligned with eachother like the aligned cells in the menus of GtkComboBox \nGtkCellView is GtkOrientable in order to decide in which orientation the underlying GtkCellAreaContext should be allocated. Taking the GtkComboBox menu as an example cellviews should be oriented horizontally if the menus are listed top to bottom and thus all share the same width but may have separate individual heights left to right menus should be allocated vertically since they all share the same height but may have variable widths \nGtkCellView has a single CSS node with name cellview. \n"});
