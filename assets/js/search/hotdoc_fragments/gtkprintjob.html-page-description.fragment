You only need to deal directly with print jobs if you use the non portable GtkPrintUnixDialog API. \nUse gtk_print_job_get_surface to obtain the cairo surface onto which the pages must be drawn. Use gtk_print_job_send to send the finished job to the printer. If you don t use cairo GtkPrintJob also supports printing of manually generated postscript via gtk_print_job_set_source_file. \n"});
