fragment_downloaded_cb({"url": "gtklayout.html#page-description", "fragment": "GtkLayout is similar to GtkDrawingArea in that it s a blank slate and doesn t do anything except paint a blank background by default. It s different in that it supports scrolling natively due to implementing GtkScrollable and can contain child widgets since it s a GtkContainer. \nIf you just want to draw a GtkDrawingArea is a better choice since it has lower overhead. If you just need to position child widgets at specific points then GtkFixed provides that functionality on its own. \n"});
