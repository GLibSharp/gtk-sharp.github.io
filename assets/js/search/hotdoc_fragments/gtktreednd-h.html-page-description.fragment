fragment_downloaded_cb({"url": "gtktreednd-h.html#page-description", "fragment": "GTK supports Drag and Drop in tree views with a high level and a low level API. \nThe low level API consists of the GTK DND API augmented by some treeview utility functions gtk_tree_view_set_drag_dest_row gtk_tree_view_get_drag_dest_row gtk_tree_view_get_dest_row_at_pos gtk_tree_view_create_row_drag_icon gtk_tree_set_row_drag_data and gtk_tree_get_row_drag_data. This API leaves a lot of flexibility but nothing is done automatically and implementing advanced features like hover to open rows or autoscrolling on top of this API is a lot of work. \nOn the other hand if you write to the high level API then all the bookkeeping of rows is done for you as well as things like hover to open and auto scroll but your models have to implement the GtkTreeDragSource and GtkTreeDragDest interfaces. \n"});
