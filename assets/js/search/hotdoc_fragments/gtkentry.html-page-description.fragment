fragment_downloaded_cb({"url": "gtkentry.html#page-description", "fragment": "The GtkEntry widget is a single line text entry widget. A fairly large set of key bindings are supported by default. If the entered text is longer than the allocation of the widget the widget will scroll so that the cursor position is visible. \nWhen using an entry for passwords and other sensitive information it can be put into password mode using gtk_entry_set_visibility. In this mode entered text is displayed using a invisible character. By default GTK picks the best invisible character that is available in the current font but it can be changed with gtk_entry_set_invisible_char. Since GTK displays a warning when Caps Lock or input methods might interfere with entering text in a password entry. The warning can be turned off with the caps lock warning property. \nSince GtkEntry has the ability to display progress or activity information behind the text. To make an entry display such information use gtk_entry_set_progress_fraction or gtk_entry_set_progress_pulse_step. \nAdditionally GtkEntry can show icons at either side of the entry. These icons can be activatable by clicking can be set up as drag source and can have tooltips. To add an icon use gtk_entry_set_icon_from_gicon or one of the various other functions that set an icon from a stock id an icon name or a pixbuf. To trigger an action when the user clicks an icon connect to the icon press signal. To allow DND operations from an icon use gtk_entry_set_icon_drag_source. To set a tooltip on an icon use gtk_entry_set_icon_tooltip_text or the corresponding function for markup. \nNote that functionality or information that is only available by clicking on an icon in an entry may not be accessible at all to users which are not able to use a mouse or other pointing device. It is therefore recommended that any such functionality should also be available by other means e.g. via the context menu of the entry. \nGtkEntry has a main node with the name entry. Depending on the properties of the entry the style classes read only and flat may appear. The style classes warning and error may also be used with entries. \nWhen the entry shows icons it adds subnodes with the name image and the style class left or right depending on where the icon appears. \nWhen the entry has a selection it adds a subnode with the name selection. \nWhen the entry is in overwrite mode it adds a subnode with the name block cursor that determines how the block cursor is drawn. \nWhen the entry shows progress it adds a subnode with the name progress. The node has the style class pulse when the shown progress is pulsing. \nThe CSS node for a context menu is added as a subnode below entry as well. \nThe undershoot nodes are used to draw the underflow indication when content is scrolled out of view. These nodes get the left and right style classes added depending on where the indication is drawn. \nWhen touch is used and touch selection handles are shown they are using CSS nodes with name cursor handle. They get the top or bottom style class depending on where they are shown in relation to the selection. If there is just a single handle for the text cursor it gets the style class insertion cursor. \n"});
