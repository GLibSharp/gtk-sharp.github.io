If you need a literal underscore character in a label use __ two underscores The first underlined character represents a keyboard accelerator called a mnemonic. The mnemonic key can be used to activate another widget chosen automatically or explicitly using gtk_label_set_mnemonic_widget. \nIf gtk_label_set_mnemonic_widget is not called then the first activatable ancestor of the GtkLabel will be chosen as the mnemonic widget.
