fragment_downloaded_cb({"url": "gtktreemodelsort.html#page-description", "fragment": "The GtkTreeModelSort is a model which implements the GtkTreeSortable interface. It does not hold any data itself but rather is created with a child model and proxies its data. It has identical column types to this child model and the changes in the child are propagated. The primary purpose of this model is to provide a way to sort a different model without modifying it. Note that the sort function used by GtkTreeModelSort is not guaranteed to be stable. \nThe use of this is best demonstrated through an example. In the following sample code we create two GtkTreeView widgets each with a view of the same data. As the model is wrapped here by a GtkTreeModelSort the two GtkTreeView can each sort their view of the data without affecting the other. By contrast if we simply put the same model in each widget then sorting the first would sort the second. \nTo demonstrate how to access the underlying child model from the sort model the next example will be a callback for the GtkTreeSelection changed signal. In this callback we get a string from COLUMN_1 of the model. We then modify the string find the same selected row on the child model and change the row there. \n"});
