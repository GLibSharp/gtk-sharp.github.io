The icon is used when the window is minimized also known as iconified Some window managers or desktop environments may also place it in the window frame or display it in other contexts. On others the icon is not used at all so your mileage may vary. \ngtk_window_set_icon_list allows you to pass in the same icon in several hand drawn sizes. The list should contain the natural sizes your icon is available in that is don t scale the image before passing it to GTK Scaling is postponed until the last minute when the desired final size is known to allow best quality. \nBy passing several sizes you may improve the final image quality of the icon by reducing or eliminating automatic image scaling. \nRecommended sizes to provide x16 x32 x48 at minimum and larger images x64 x128 if you have them. \nSee also gtk_window_set_default_icon_list to set the icon for all windows in your application in one go. \nNote that transient windows those who have been set transient for another window using gtk_window_set_transient_for will inherit their icon from their transient parent.
