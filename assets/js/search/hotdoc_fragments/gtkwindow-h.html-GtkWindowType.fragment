Most things you d consider a window should have type Gtk.WindowType.Toplevel windows with this type are managed by the window manager and have a frame by default call Gtk.Window.SetDecorated to toggle the frame Windows with type Gtk.WindowType.Popup are ignored by the window manager window manager keybindings won t work on them the window manager won t decorate the window with a frame many GTK features that rely on the window manager will not work e.g. resize grips and maximization minimization Gtk.WindowType.Popup is used to implement widgets such as Gtk.Menu or tooltips that you normally don t think of as windows per se.
