The layout spacing can be altered by the programmer or if desired by the user to alter the feel of a program to a small degree. \ngtk_button_box_get_layout and gtk_button_box_set_layout retrieve and alter the method used to spread the buttons in a button box across the container respectively. \nThe main purpose of GtkButtonBox is to make sure the children have all the same size. GtkButtonBox gives all children the same size but it does allow outliers to keep their own larger size. \nTo exempt individual children from homogeneous sizing regardless of their outlier status you can set the non homogeneous child property. \nGtkButtonBox uses a single CSS node with name buttonbox. \n"});
