The position of each cursor is stored as a zero width rectangle. The strong cursor location is the location where characters of the directionality equal to the base direction of the paragraph are inserted. The weak cursor location is the location where characters of the directionality opposite to the base direction of the paragraph are inserted. \nIf iter is null the actual cursor position is used. \nNote that if iter happens to be the actual cursor position and there is currently an IM preedit sequence being entered the returned locations will be adjusted to account for the preedit cursor s offset within the preedit sequence. \nThe rectangle position is in buffer coordinates use Gtk.TextView.BufferToWindowCoords to convert these coordinates to coordinates for one of the windows in the text view. \nParameters \na Gtk.TextIter \nlocation to store the strong cursor position may be null \nlocation to store the weak cursor position may be null \nSince \n"});
