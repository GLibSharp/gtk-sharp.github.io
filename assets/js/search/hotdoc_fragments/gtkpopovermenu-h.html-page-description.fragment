fragment_downloaded_cb({"url": "gtkpopovermenu-h.html#page-description", "fragment": "GtkPopoverMenu is a subclass of GtkPopover that treats its children like menus and allows switching between them. It is meant to be used primarily together with GtkModelButton but any widget can be used such as GtkSpinButton or GtkScale. In this respect GtkPopoverMenu is more flexible than popovers that are created from a GMenuModel with gtk_popover_new_from_model. \nTo add a child as a submenu set the GtkPopoverMenu submenu child property to the name of the submenu. To let the user open this submenu add a GtkModelButton whose GtkModelButton menu name property is set to the name you ve given to the submenu. \nBy convention the first child of a submenu should be a GtkModelButton to switch back to the parent menu. Such a button should use the GtkModelButton inverted and GtkModelButton centered properties to achieve a title like appearance and place the submenu indicator at the opposite side. To switch back to the main menu use main as the menu name. \nGtkPopoverMenu is just a subclass of GtkPopover that adds custom content to it therefore it has the same CSS nodes. It is one of the cases that add a menu style class to the popover s contents node. \n"});
