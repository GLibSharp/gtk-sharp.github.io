Equivalent to calling Gtk.prototype.get_mark to get the mark named selection_bound but very slightly more efficient and involves less typing. \nThe currently selected text in buffer is the region between the selection_bound and insert marks. If selection_bound and insert are in the same place then there is no current selection. Gtk.prototype.get_selection_bounds is another convenient function for handling the selection if you just want to know whether there s a selection and what its bounds are. \nParameters \na Gtk.TextBuffer \nselection bound mark \nReturns the mark that represents the selection bound.
