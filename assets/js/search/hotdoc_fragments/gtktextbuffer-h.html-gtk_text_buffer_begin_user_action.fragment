The operations between Gtk.TextBuffer.BeginUserAction and Gtk.TextBuffer.EndUserAction can then be grouped when creating an undo stack. Gtk.TextBuffer maintains a count of calls to Gtk.TextBuffer.BeginUserAction that have not been closed with a call to Gtk.TextBuffer.EndUserAction and emits the begin user action and end user action signals only for the outermost pair of calls. This allows you to build user actions from other user actions. \nThe interactive buffer mutation functions such as Gtk.TextBuffer.InsertInteractive automatically call begin end user action around the buffer operations they perform so there s no need to add extra calls if you user action consists solely of a single call to one of those functions. \n"});
