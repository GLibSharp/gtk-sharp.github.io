The accel_group needs to be added to the widget s toplevel via gtk_window_add_accel_group and the signal must be of type G_SIGNAL_ACTION. Accelerators added through this function are not user changeable during runtime. If you want to support accelerators that can be changed by the user use gtk_accel_map_add_entry and gtk_widget_set_accel_path or gtk_menu_item_set_accel_path instead. \nParameters \nwidget to install an accelerator on \nwidget signal to emit on accelerator activation \naccel group for this widget added to its toplevel \nGDK keyval of the accelerator \nmodifier key combination of the accelerator \nflag accelerators e.g. GTK_ACCEL_VISIBLE \nInstalls an accelerator for this widget in accel_group that causes accel_signal to be emitted if the accelerator is activated.
