The internal format does not comply to any standard rich text format and only works between Gtk.TextBuffer instances. It is capable of serializing all of a text buffer s tags and embedded pixbufs. \nThis function is just a wrapper around Gtk.TextBuffer.RegisterSerializeFormat. The mime type used for registering is application x gtk text buffer rich text or application x gtk text buffer rich text format tagset_name if a tagset_name was passed. \nThe tagset_name can be used to restrict the transfer of rich text to buffers with compatible sets of tags in order to avoid unknown tags from being pasted. It is probably the common case to pass an identifier null here since the null tagset requires the receiving buffer to deal with with pasting of arbitrary tags. \nParameters \nan optional tagset name on null \nthe Gdk.Atom that corresponds to the newly registered format s mime type. \nSince \n"});
