Useful if you want to line up the text in an entry with some other text e.g. when using the entry to implement editable cells in a sheet widget. \nAlso useful to convert mouse events into coordinates inside the PangoLayout e.g. to take some action if some part of the entry text is clicked. \nNote that as the user scrolls around in the entry the offsets will change you ll need to connect to the notify scroll offset signal to track this. Remember when using the PangoLayout functions you need to convert to and from pixels using PANGO_PIXELS or PANGO_SCALE. \nKeep in mind that the layout text may contain a preedit string so gtk_entry_layout_index_to_text_index and gtk_entry_text_index_to_layout_index are needed to convert byte indices in the layout to byte indices in the entry contents. \nParameters \na GtkEntry \nlocation to store X offset of layout or NULL \nlocation to store Y offset of layout or NULL \nObtains the position of the Pango.Layout used to render text in the entry in widget coordinates.
