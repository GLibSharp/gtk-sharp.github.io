It implements the GtkAppChooser interface. \nInitially a GtkAppChooserButton selects the first application in its list which will either be the most recently used application or if show default item is TRUE the default application. \nThe list of applications shown in a GtkAppChooserButton includes the recommended applications for the given content type. When show default item is set the default application is also included. To let the user chooser other applications you can set the show dialog item property which allows to open a full GtkAppChooserDialog. \nIt is possible to add custom items to the list using gtk_app_chooser_button_append_custom_item. These items cause the custom item activated signal to be emitted when they are selected. \nTo track changes in the selected application use the changed signal. \n"});
