For instance one could use it to add headers in front of the first item of a new kind in a list sorted by the kind. \nThe update_header can look at the current header widget using Gtk.ListBoxRow.GetHeader and either update the state of the widget as needed or set a new one using Gtk.ListBoxRow.SetHeader. If no header is needed set the header to null. \nNote that you may get many calls update_header to this for a particular row when e.g. changing things that don t affect the header. In this case it is important for performance to not blindly replace an existing header with an identical one. \nThe update_header function will be called for each row after the call and it will continue to be called each time a row changes via Gtk.ListBoxRow.Changed and when the row before changes either by Gtk.ListBoxRow.Changed on the previous row or when the previous row becomes a different row It is also called for all rows when Gtk.ListBox.InvalidateHeaders is called. \nParameters \ncallback that lets you add row headers \nuser data passed to update_header \ndestroy notifier for user_data \nSince \n"});
