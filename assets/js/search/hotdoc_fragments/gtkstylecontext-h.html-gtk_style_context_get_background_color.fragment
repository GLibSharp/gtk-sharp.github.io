CSS has no concept of background color as a background can be an image or a gradient or any other pattern including solid colors. \nThe only reason why you would call Gtk.StyleContext.GetBackgroundColor is to use the returned value to draw the background with it the correct way to achieve this result is to use Gtk.Global.RenderBackground instead along with CSS style classes to modify the color to be rendered. \nParameters \nreturn value for the background color \nSince \ndeprecated Use gtk_render_background instead. \n"});
