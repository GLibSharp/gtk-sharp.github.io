fragment_downloaded_cb({"url": "gtkwindowgroup.html#page-description", "fragment": "A GtkWindowGroup restricts the effect of grabs to windows in the same group thereby making window groups almost behave like separate applications. \nA window can be a member in at most one window group at a time. Windows that have not been explicitly assigned to a group are implicitly treated like windows of the default window group. \nGtkWindowGroup objects are referenced by each window in the group so once you have added all windows to a GtkWindowGroup you can drop the initial reference to the window group with g_object_unref. If the windows in the window group are subsequently destroyed then they will be removed from the window group and drop their references on the window group when all window have been removed the window group will be freed. \n"});
