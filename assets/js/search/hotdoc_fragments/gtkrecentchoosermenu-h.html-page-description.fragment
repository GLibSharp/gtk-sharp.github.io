fragment_downloaded_cb({"url": "gtkrecentchoosermenu-h.html#page-description", "fragment": "GtkRecentChooserMenu is a widget suitable for displaying recently used files inside a menu. It can be used to set a sub menu of a GtkMenuItem using gtk_menu_item_set_submenu or as the menu of a GtkMenuToolButton. \nNote that GtkRecentChooserMenu does not have any methods of its own. Instead you should use the functions that work on a GtkRecentChooser. \nNote also that GtkRecentChooserMenu does not support multiple filters as it has no way to let the user choose between them as the GtkRecentChooserWidget and GtkRecentChooserDialog widgets do. Thus using gtk_recent_chooser_add_filter on a GtkRecentChooserMenu widget will yield the same effects as using gtk_recent_chooser_set_filter replacing any currently set filter with the supplied filter gtk_recent_chooser_remove_filter will remove any currently set GtkRecentFilter object and will unset the current filter gtk_recent_chooser_list_filters will return a list containing a single GtkRecentFilter object. \nRecently used files are supported since GTK \n"});
