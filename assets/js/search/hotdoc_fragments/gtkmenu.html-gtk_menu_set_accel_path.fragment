The main purpose of this function is to spare the programmer the inconvenience of having to call gtk_menu_item_set_accel_path on each menu item that should support runtime user changable accelerators. Instead by just calling gtk_menu_set_accel_path on their parent each menu item of this menu that contains a label describing its purpose automatically gets an accel path assigned. \nFor example a menu containing menu items New and Exit will after gtk_menu_set_accel_path menu Gnumeric Sheet File has been called assign its items the accel paths Gnumeric Sheet File New and Gnumeric Sheet File Exit \nAssigning accel paths to menu items then enables the user to change their accelerators at runtime. More details about accelerator paths and their default setups can be found at gtk_accel_map_add_entry. \nNote that accel_path string will be stored in a GQuark. Therefore if you pass a static string you can save some memory by interning it first with g_intern_static_string. \nParameters \na valid GtkMenu \na valid accelerator path \nSets an accelerator path for this menu from which accelerator paths for its immediate children its menu items can be constructed. The main purpose of this function is to spare the programmer the inconvenience of having to call Gtk.MenuItem.set_accel_path on each menu item that should support runtime user changable accelerators. Instead by just calling Gtk.Menu.set_accel_path on their parent each menu item of this menu that contains a label describing its purpose automatically gets an accel path assigned. \nFor example a menu containing menu items New and Exit will after gtk_menu_set_accel_path menu Gnumeric Sheet File has been called assign its items the accel paths Gnumeric Sheet File New and Gnumeric Sheet File Exit \nAssigning accel paths to menu items then enables the user to change their accelerators at runtime. More details about accelerator paths and their default setups can be found at Gtk.AccelMap.add_entry. \nNote that accel_path string will be stored in a GLib.Quark. Therefore if you pass a static string you can save some memory by interning it first with GLib.intern_static_string. \nParameters \na valid Gtk.Menu \na valid accelerator path \nSets an accelerator path for this menu from which accelerator paths for its immediate children its menu items can be constructed. The main purpose of this function is to spare the programmer the inconvenience of having to call Gtk.prototype.set_accel_path on each menu item that should support runtime user changable accelerators.
