This information is useful for on screen keyboards and similar input methods to decide which keys should be presented to the user. \nNote that the purpose is not meant to impose a totally strict rule about allowed characters and does not replace input validation. It is fine for an on screen keyboard to let the user override the character set restriction that is expressed by the purpose. The application is expected to validate the entry contents even if it specified a purpose. \nThe difference between GTK_INPUT_PURPOSE_DIGITS and GTK_INPUT_PURPOSE_NUMBER is that the former accepts only digits while the latter also some punctuation like commas or points plus minus and e or E as in E \nThis enumeration may be extended in the future input methods should interpret unknown values as free form \n"});
