Note that you shouldn t assume the window is definitely unmaximized afterward because other entities e.g. the user or window manager gtk X11 arch could maximize it again and not all window managers honor requests to unmaximize. But normally the window will end up unmaximized. Just don t write code that crashes if not. \nYou can track maximization via the window state event signal on Gtk.Widget. \n"});
