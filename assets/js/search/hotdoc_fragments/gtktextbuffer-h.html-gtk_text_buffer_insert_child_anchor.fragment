fragment_downloaded_cb({"url": "gtktextbuffer-h.html#gtk_text_buffer_insert_child_anchor", "fragment": "Gtk.TextBuffer.InsertChildAnchor \nInserts a child widget anchor into the text buffer at iter. The anchor will be counted as one character in character counts and when obtaining the buffer contents as a string will be represented by the Unicode object replacement character xFFFC. Note that the slice variants for obtaining portions of the buffer as a string include this character for child anchors but the text variants do not. E.g. see Gtk.TextBuffer.GetSlice and Gtk.TextBuffer.GetText. Consider Gtk.TextBuffer.CreateChildAnchor as a more convenient alternative to this function. The buffer will add a reference to the anchor so you can unref it after insertion. \nParameters \nlocation to insert the anchor \na Gtk.TextChildAnchor \n"});
