Note that offset and n_chars are in characters not in bytes which differs from the usage other places in Gtk.IMContext. \nIn order to use this function you should first call Gtk.IMContext.GetSurrounding to get the current context and call this function immediately afterwards to make sure that you know what you are deleting. You should also account for the fact that even if the signal was handled the input context might not have deleted all the characters that were requested to be deleted. \nThis function is used by an input method that wants to make subsitutions in the existing text in response to new input. It is not useful for applications. \nParameters \noffset from cursor position in chars a negative value means start before the cursor. \nnumber of characters to delete. \ntrue if the signal was handled. \n"});
