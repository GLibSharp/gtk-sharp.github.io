fragment_downloaded_cb({"url": "gtkradiobutton.html#page-description", "fragment": "A single radio button performs the same basic function as a GtkCheckButton as its position in the object hierarchy reflects. It is only when multiple radio buttons are grouped together that they become a different user interface component in their own right. \nEvery radio button is a member of some group of radio buttons. When one is selected all other radio buttons in the same group are deselected. A GtkRadioButton is one way of giving the user a choice from many options. \nRadio button widgets are created with gtk_radio_button_new passing NULL as the argument if this is the first radio button in a group. In subsequent calls the group you wish to add this button to should be passed as an argument. Optionally gtk_radio_button_new_with_label can be used if you want a text label on the radio button. \nAlternatively when adding widgets to an existing group of radio buttons use gtk_radio_button_new_from_widget with a GtkRadioButton that already has a group assigned to it. The convenience function gtk_radio_button_new_with_label_from_widget is also provided. \nTo retrieve the group a GtkRadioButton is assigned to use gtk_radio_button_get_group. \nTo remove a GtkRadioButton from one group and make it part of a new one use gtk_radio_button_set_group. \nThe group list does not need to be freed as each GtkRadioButton will remove itself and its list item when it is destroyed. \nA GtkRadioButton with indicator see gtk_check_button_set_draw_indicator has a main CSS node with name radiobutton and a subnode with name radio. \nA GtkRadioButton without indicator changes the name of its main node to button and adds a radio style class to it. The subnode is invisible in this case. \nWhen an unselected button in the group is clicked the clicked button receives the toggled signal as does the previously selected button. Inside the toggled handler gtk_toggle_button_get_active can be used to determine if the button has been selected or deselected. \n"});
