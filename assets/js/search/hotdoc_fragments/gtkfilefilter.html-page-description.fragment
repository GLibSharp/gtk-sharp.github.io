fragment_downloaded_cb({"url": "gtkfilefilter.html#page-description", "fragment": "A GtkFileFilter can be used to restrict the files being shown in a GtkFileChooser. Files can be filtered based on their name with gtk_file_filter_add_pattern on their mime type with gtk_file_filter_add_mime_type or by a custom filter function with gtk_file_filter_add_custom \nFiltering by mime types handles aliasing and subclassing of mime types e.g. a filter for text plain also matches a file with mime type application rtf since application rtf is a subclass of text plain. Note that GtkFileFilter allows wildcards for the subtype of a mime type so you can e.g. filter for image \nNormally filters are used by adding them to a GtkFileChooser see gtk_file_chooser_add_filter but it is also possible to manually use a filter on a file with gtk_file_filter_filter. \nThe GtkFileFilter implementation of the GtkBuildable interface supports adding rules using the and elements and listing the rules within. Specifying a or has the same effect as as calling gtk_file_filter_add_mime_type or gtk_file_filter_add_pattern. \nAn example of a UI definition fragment specifying GtkFileFilter rules \n"});
