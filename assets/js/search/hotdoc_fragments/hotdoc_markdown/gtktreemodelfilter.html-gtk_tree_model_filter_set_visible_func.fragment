The function should return TRUE if the given row should be visible and FALSE otherwise. \nIf the condition calculated by the function changes over time e.g. because it depends on some global parameters you must call gtk_tree_model_filter_refilter to keep the visibility information of the model up to date. \nNote that func is called whenever a row is inserted when it may still be empty. The visible function should therefore take special care of empty rows like in the example below. \nNote that gtk_tree_model_filter_set_visible_func or gtk_tree_model_filter_set_visible_column can only be called once for a given filter model. \nParameters \nA GtkTreeModelFilter \nA GtkTreeModelFilterVisibleFunc the visible function \nUser data to pass to the visible function or NULL \nDestroy notifier of data or NULL \nSince \nSets the visible function used when filtering the filter to be func.
