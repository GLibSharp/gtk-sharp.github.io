If position is or larger than the number of rows in the list then the new row will be appended to the list. The row will be filled with the values given to this function. \nCalling gtk_list_store_insert_with_values list_store iter position... has the same effect as calling \nwith the difference that the former will only emit a row_inserted signal while the latter will emit row_inserted row_changed and if the list store is sorted rows_reordered. Since emitting the rows_reordered signal repeatedly can affect the performance of the program gtk_list_store_insert_with_values should generally be preferred when inserting rows in a sorted list store. \nParameters \nA GtkListStore \nAn unset GtkTreeIter to set to the new row or NULL \nposition to insert the new row or to append after existing rows \npairs of column number and value terminated with \nSince \n"});
