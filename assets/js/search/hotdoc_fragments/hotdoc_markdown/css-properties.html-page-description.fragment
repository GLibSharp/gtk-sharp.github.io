All GTK specific properties have a gtk prefix. \nAll properties support the following keywords inherit initial unset with the same meaning as in CSS. \nThe following basic datatypes are used throughout \nLength values with the em or ex units are resolved using the font size value unless they occur in setting the font size itself in which case they are resolved using the inherited font size value. \nThe rem unit is resolved using the initial font size value which is not quite the same as the CSS definition of rem. \nWhereever a number is allowed GTK also accepts a Windows specific theme size \nThe calc notation adds considerable expressive power. There are limits on what types can be combined in such an expression e.g. it does not make sense to add a number and a time For the full details see the CSS3 Values and Units spec. \nA common pattern among shorthand properties called four sides is one where one to four values can be specified to determine a value for each side of an area. In this case the specified values are interpreted as follows \nThe color property specifies the color to use for text icons and other foreground rendering. The opacity property specifies the opacity that is used to composite the widget onto its parent widget. The filter property specifies filters to be applied to the rendering. \nThe font properties determine the font to use for rendering text. Relative font sizes and weights are resolved relative to the inherited value for these properties. \nThe caret properties provide a way to change the appearance of the insertion caret in editable text. \nThe text decoration properties determine whether to apply extra decorations when rendering text. \nThe gtk icon source property is used by widgets that are rendering built in icons such as arrows expanders spinners checks or radios. \nThe gtk icon style property determines the preferred style for application provided icons. \nThe gtk icon transform and gtk icon shadow properties affect the rendering of both built in and application provided icons. \ngtk icon palette defines a color palette for recoloring symbolic icons. The recognized names for colors in symbolic icons are error warning and success. The default palette maps these three names to symbolic colors with the names error_color warning_color and error_color. \nGTK uses the CSS outline properties to render the focus rectangle \nAs in CSS the background color is rendered underneath all the background image layers so it will only be visible if background images are absent or have transparency. \nAlternatively multiple backgrounds can be blended using the background blend mode property. \nbinding name must have been assigned to a binding set with a binding set rule. \nThe border spacing property is respected by GtkBox and GtkGrid and by box gadgets that are used internally in complex widgets. \n"});
