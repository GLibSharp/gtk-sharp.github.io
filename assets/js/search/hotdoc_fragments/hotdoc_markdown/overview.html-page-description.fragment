It works on many UNIX like platforms Windows and OS X. GTK is released under the GNU Library General Public License GNU LGPL which allows for flexible licensing of client applications. GTK has a C based object oriented architecture that allows for maximum flexibility. Bindings for many other languages have been written including C Objective C Guile Scheme Perl Python TOM Ada95 Free Pascal and Eiffel. \nGTK depends on the following libraries \nGLib A general purpose utility library not specific to graphical user interfaces. GLib provides many useful data types macros type conversions string utilities file utilities a main loop abstraction and so on. \nGObject A library that provides a type system a collection of fundamental types including an object type a signal system. \nGIO A modern easy to use VFS API including abstractions for files drives volumes stream IO as well as network programming and DBus communication. \ncairo Cairo is a D graphics library with support for multiple output devices. \nPango Pango is a library for internationalized text handling. It centers around the PangoLayout object representing a paragraph of text. Pango provides the engine for GtkTextView GtkLabel GtkEntry and other widgets that display text. \nATK ATK is the Accessibility Toolkit. It provides a set of generic interfaces allowing accessibility technologies to interact with a graphical user interface. For example a screen reader uses ATK to discover the text in an interface and read it to blind users. GTK widgets have built in support for accessibility using the ATK framework. \nGdkPixbuf This is a small library which allows you to create GdkPixbuf pixel buffer objects from image data or image files. Use a GdkPixbuf in combination with GtkImage to display images. \nGDK GDK is the abstraction layer that allows GTK to support multiple windowing systems. GDK provides window system facilities on X11 Windows and OS X. \nGTK The GTK library itself contains widgets that is GUI components such as GtkButton or GtkTextView. \n"});
