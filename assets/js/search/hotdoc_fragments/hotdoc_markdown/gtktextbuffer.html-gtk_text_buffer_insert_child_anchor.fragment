The anchor will be counted as one character in character counts and when obtaining the buffer contents as a string will be represented by the Unicode object replacement character xFFFC. Note that the slice variants for obtaining portions of the buffer as a string include this character for child anchors but the text variants do not. E.g. see gtk_text_buffer_get_slice and gtk_text_buffer_get_text. Consider gtk_text_buffer_create_child_anchor as a more convenient alternative to this function. The buffer will add a reference to the anchor so you can unref it after insertion. \nParameters \na GtkTextBuffer \nlocation to insert the anchor \na GtkTextChildAnchor \nInserts a child widget anchor into the text buffer at iter.
