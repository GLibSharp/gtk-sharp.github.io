Valid priorities start at and go to one less than gtk_text_tag_table_get_size. Each tag in a table has a unique priority setting the priority of one tag shifts the priorities of all the other tags in the table to maintain a unique priority for each tag. Higher priority tags win if two tags both set the same text attribute. When adding a tag to a tag table it will be assigned the highest priority in the table by default so normally the precedence of a set of tags is the order in which they were added to the table or created with gtk_text_buffer_create_tag which adds the tag to the buffer s table automatically. \nParameters \na GtkTextTag \nthe new priority \nSets the priority of a Gtk.TextTag.
