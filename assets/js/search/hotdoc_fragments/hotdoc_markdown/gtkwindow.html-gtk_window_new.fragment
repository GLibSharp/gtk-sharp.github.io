Nearly always the type of the window should be GTK_WINDOW_TOPLEVEL. If you re implementing something like a popup menu from scratch which is a bad idea just use GtkMenu you might use GTK_WINDOW_POPUP. GTK_WINDOW_POPUP is not for dialogs though in some other toolkits dialogs are called popups In GTK GTK_WINDOW_POPUP means a pop up menu or pop up tooltip. On X11 popup windows are not controlled by the window manager gtk X11 arch \nIf you simply want an undecorated window no window borders use gtk_window_set_decorated don t use GTK_WINDOW_POPUP. \nAll top level windows created by gtk_window_new are stored in an internal top level window list. This list can be obtained from gtk_window_list_toplevels. Due to Gtk keeping a reference to the window internally gtk_window_new does not return a reference to the caller. \nTo delete a GtkWindow call gtk_widget_destroy. \nParameters \ntype of window \na new GtkWindow. \nCreates a new Gtk.Window which is a toplevel window that can contain other widgets.
