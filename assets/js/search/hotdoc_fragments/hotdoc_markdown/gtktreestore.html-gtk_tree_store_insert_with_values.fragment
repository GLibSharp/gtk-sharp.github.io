If position is or larger than the number of rows on the list then the new row will be appended to the list. The row will be filled with the values given to this function. \nCalling gtk_tree_store_insert_with_values tree_store iter position has the same effect as calling \nwith the different that the former will only emit a row_inserted signal while the latter will emit row_inserted row_changed and if the tree store is sorted rows_reordered. Since emitting the rows_reordered signal repeatedly can affect the performance of the program gtk_tree_store_insert_with_values should generally be preferred when inserting rows in a sorted tree store. \nParameters \nA GtkTreeStore \nAn unset GtkTreeIter to set the new row or NULL. \nA valid GtkTreeIter or NULL \nposition to insert the new row or to append after existing rows \npairs of column number and value terminated with \nSince \n"});
