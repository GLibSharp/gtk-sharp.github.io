Using this function is unflexible and should really only be used if calculating the size of a cell is too slow ie a massive number of cells displayed If number_of_rows is then the fixed height is unset and the height is determined by the properties again. \nParameters \nA Gtk.CellRendererText \nNumber of rows of text each cell renderer is allocated or \nSets the height of a renderer to explicitly be determined by the font and y_pad property set on it.
