First the application can call Gtk.PlacesSidebar.SetOpenFlags using these flags as a bitmask. This tells the sidebar that the application is able to open folders selected from the sidebar in various ways for example in new tabs or in new windows in addition to the normal mode. \nSecond when one of these values gets passed back to the application in the OpenLocation signal it means that the application should open the selected location in the normal way in a new tab or in a new window. The sidebar takes care of determining the desired way to open the location based on the modifier keys that the user is pressing at the time the selection is made. \nIf the application never calls Gtk.PlacesSidebar.SetOpenFlags then the sidebar will only use Gtk.PlacesOpenFlags.Normal in the OpenLocation signal. This is the default mode of operation. \n"});
