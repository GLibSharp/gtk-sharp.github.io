To add a GtkToolItemGroup to a GtkToolPalette use gtk_container_add. \nThe easiest way to use drag and drop with GtkToolPalette is to call gtk_tool_palette_add_drag_dest with the desired drag source palette and the desired drag target widget. Then gtk_tool_palette_get_drag_item can be used to get the dragged item in the drag data received signal handler of the drag target. \nGtkToolPalette has a single CSS node named toolpalette. \n"});
