It is able to parse CSS like css overview input in order to style widgets. \nAn application can make GTK parse a specific CSS style sheet by calling gtk_css_provider_load_from_file or gtk_css_provider_load_from_resource and adding the provider with gtk_style_context_add_provider or gtk_style_context_add_provider_for_screen. \nIn addition certain files will be read when GTK is initialized. First the file XDG_CONFIG_HOME gtk gtk.css is loaded if it exists. Then GTK loads the first existing file among XDG_DATA_HOME themes theme name gtk VERSION gtk.css HOME themes theme name gtk VERSION gtk.css XDG_DATA_DIRS themes theme name gtk VERSION gtk.css and DATADIR share themes THEME gtk VERSION gtk.css where THEME is the name of the current theme see the GtkSettings gtk theme name setting DATADIR is the prefix configured when GTK was compiled unless overridden by the GTK_DATA_PREFIX environment variable and VERSION is the GTK version number. If no file is found for the current version GTK tries older versions all the way back to \nIn the same way GTK tries to load a gtk keys.css file for the current key theme as defined by GtkSettings gtk key theme name. \n"});
