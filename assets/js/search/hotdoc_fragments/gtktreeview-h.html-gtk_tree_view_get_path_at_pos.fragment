That is x and y are relative to an events coordinates. Widget relative coordinates must be converted using gtk_tree_view_convert_widget_to_bin_window_coords. It is primarily for things like popup menus. If path is non NULL then it will be filled with the GtkTreePath at that point. This path should be freed with gtk_tree_path_free. If column is non NULL then it will be filled with the column at that point. cell_x and cell_y return the coordinates relative to the cell background i.e. the background_area passed to gtk_cell_renderer_render This function is only meaningful if tree_view is realized. Therefore this function will always return FALSE if tree_view is not realized or does not have a model. \nFor converting widget coordinates eg. the ones you get from GtkWidget query tooltip please see gtk_tree_view_convert_widget_to_bin_window_coords. \nParameters \nA GtkTreeView. \nThe x position to be identified relative to bin_window \nThe y position to be identified relative to bin_window \nA pointer to a GtkTreePath pointer to be filled in or NULL \nA pointer to a GtkTreeViewColumn pointer to be filled in or NULL \nA pointer where the X coordinate relative to the cell can be placed or NULL \nA pointer where the Y coordinate relative to the cell can be placed or NULL \nTRUE if a row exists at that coordinate. \nFinds the path at the point x y relative to bin_window coordinates.
