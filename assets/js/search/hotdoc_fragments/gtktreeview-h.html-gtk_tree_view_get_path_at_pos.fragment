fragment_downloaded_cb({"url": "gtktreeview-h.html#gtk_tree_view_get_path_at_pos", "fragment": "Gtk.TreeView.GetPathAtPos \nFinds the path at the point x y relative to bin_window coordinates. That is x and y are relative to an events coordinates. Widget relative coordinates must be converted using Gtk.TreeView.ConvertWidgetToBinWindowCoords. It is primarily for things like popup menus. If path is non NULL then it will be filled with the Gtk.TreePath at that point. This path should be freed with Gtk.TreePath.Free. If column is non NULL then it will be filled with the column at that point. cell_x and cell_y return the coordinates relative to the cell background i.e. the background_area passed to gtk_cell_renderer_render not introspectable This function is only meaningful if tree_view is realized. Therefore this function will always return false if tree_view is not realized or does not have a model. \nFor converting widget coordinates eg. the ones you get from GtkWidget query tooltip please see Gtk.TreeView.ConvertWidgetToBinWindowCoords. \nParameters \nThe x position to be identified relative to bin_window \nThe y position to be identified relative to bin_window \nA pointer to a Gtk.TreePath pointer to be filled in or null \nA pointer to a Gtk.TreeViewColumn pointer to be filled in or null \nA pointer where the X coordinate relative to the cell can be placed or null \nA pointer where the Y coordinate relative to the cell can be placed or null \ntrue if a row exists at that coordinate. \n"});
