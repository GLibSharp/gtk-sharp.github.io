For example widget window will be created when a widget is realized. Normally realization happens implicitly if you show a widget and all its parent containers then the widget will be realized and mapped automatically. \nRealizing a widget requires all the widget s parent widgets to be realized calling gtk_widget_realize realizes the widget s parents in addition to widget itself. If a widget is not yet inside a toplevel window when you realize it bad things will happen. \nThis function is primarily used in widget implementations and isn t very useful otherwise. Many times when you think you might need it a better approach is to connect to a signal that will be called after the widget is realized automatically such as draw. Or simply g_signal_connect to the realize signal. \nParameters \na GtkWidget \nCreates the GDK windowing system resources associated with a widget.
