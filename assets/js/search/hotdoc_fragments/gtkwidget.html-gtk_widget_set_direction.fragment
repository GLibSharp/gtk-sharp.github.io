This direction controls the primary direction for widgets containing text and also the direction in which the children of a container are packed. The ability to set the direction is present in order so that correct localization into languages with right to left reading directions can be done. Generally applications will let the default reading direction present except for containers where the containers are arranged in an order that is explicitly visual rather than logical such as buttons for text justification \nIf the direction is set to GTK_TEXT_DIR_NONE then the value set by gtk_widget_set_default_direction will be used. \nParameters \na GtkWidget \nthe new direction \nSets the reading direction on a particular widget.
