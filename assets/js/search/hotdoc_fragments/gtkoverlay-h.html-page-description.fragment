fragment_downloaded_cb({"url": "gtkoverlay-h.html#page-description", "fragment": "GtkOverlay is a container which contains a single main child on top of which it can place overlay widgets. The position of each overlay widget is determined by its GtkWidget halign and GtkWidget valign properties. E.g. a widget with both alignments set to GTK_ALIGN_START will be placed at the top left corner of the GtkOverlay container whereas an overlay with halign set to GTK_ALIGN_CENTER and valign set to GTK_ALIGN_END will be placed a the bottom edge of the GtkOverlay horizontally centered. The position can be adjusted by setting the margin properties of the child to non zero values. \nMore complicated placement of overlays is possible by connecting to the GtkOverlay get child position signal. \nThe GtkOverlay implementation of the GtkBuildable interface supports placing a child as an overlay by specifying overlay as the type attribute of a child element. \nGtkOverlay has a single CSS node with the name overlay Overlay children whose alignments cause them to be positioned at an edge get the style classes left right top and or bottom according to their position. \n"});
