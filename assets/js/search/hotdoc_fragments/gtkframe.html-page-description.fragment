If present the label is drawn in a gap in the top side of the frame. The position of the label can be controlled with gtk_frame_set_label_align. \nThe GtkFrame implementation of the GtkBuildable interface supports placing a child in the label position by specifying label as the type attribute of a element. A normal content child can be specified without specifying a type attribute. \nAn example of a UI definition fragment with GtkFrame \nGtkFrame has a main CSS node with name frame. This node can be given the style class flat which is used by themes to disable drawing of the border. To do this from code call gtk_frame_set_shadow_type with GTK_SHADOW_NONE to add the flat class or any other shadow type to remove it. \n"});
