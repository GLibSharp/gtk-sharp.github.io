fragment_downloaded_cb({"url": "gtkaboutdialog.html#page-description", "fragment": "The GtkAboutDialog offers a simple way to display information about a program like its logo name copyright website and license. It is also possible to give credits to the authors documenters translators and artists who have worked on the program. An about dialog is typically opened when the user selects the About option from the Help menu. All parts of the dialog are optional. \nAbout dialogs often contain links and email addresses. GtkAboutDialog displays these as clickable links. By default it calls gtk_show_uri_on_window when a user clicks one. The behaviour can be overridden with the activate link signal. \nTo specify a person with an email address use a string like Edgar Allan Poe edgar poe.com To specify a website with a title use a string like GTK team http www.gtk.org \nTo make constructing a GtkAboutDialog as convenient as possible you can use the function gtk_show_about_dialog which constructs and shows a dialog and keeps it around so that it can be shown again. \nNote that GTK sets a default title of _ About s on the dialog window where s is replaced by the name of the application but in order to ensure proper translation of the title applications should set the title property explicitly when constructing a GtkAboutDialog as shown in the following example \nIt is also possible to show a GtkAboutDialog like any other GtkDialog e.g. using gtk_dialog_run. In this case you might need to know that the Close button returns the GTK_RESPONSE_CANCEL response id. \n"});
