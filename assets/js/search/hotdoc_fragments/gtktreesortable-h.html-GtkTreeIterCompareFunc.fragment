If two iters compare as equal their order in the sorted model is undefined. In order to ensure that the Gtk.ITreeSortable behaves as expected the GtkTreeIterCompareFunc must define a partial order on the model i.e. it must be reflexive antisymmetric and transitive. \nFor example if model is a product catalogue then a compare function for the price column could be one which returns price_of a price_of b \nParameters \nThe Gtk.ITreeModel the comparison is within \nA Gtk.TreeIter in model \nAnother Gtk.TreeIter in model \nData passed when the compare func is assigned e.g. by Gtk.ITreeSortable.SetSortFunc \na negative integer zero or a positive integer depending on whether a sorts before with or after b \n"});
