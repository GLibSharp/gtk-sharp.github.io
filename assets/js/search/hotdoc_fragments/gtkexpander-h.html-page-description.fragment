fragment_downloaded_cb({"url": "gtkexpander-h.html#page-description", "fragment": "A GtkExpander allows the user to hide or show its child by clicking on an expander triangle similar to the triangles used in a GtkTreeView. \nNormally you use an expander as you would use any other descendant of GtkBin you create the child widget and use gtk_container_add to add it to the expander. When the expander is toggled it will take care of showing and hiding the child automatically. \nThere are situations in which you may prefer to show and hide the expanded widget yourself such as when you want to actually create the widget at expansion time. In this case create a GtkExpander but do not add a child to it. The expander widget has an GtkExpander expanded property which can be used to monitor its expansion state. You should watch this property with a signal connection as follows \nThe GtkExpander implementation of the GtkBuildable interface supports placing a child in the label position by specifying label as the type attribute of a element. A normal content child can be specified without specifying a type attribute. \nAn example of a UI definition fragment with GtkExpander \nGtkExpander has three CSS nodes the main node with the name expander a subnode with name title and node below it with name arrow. The arrow of an expander that is showing its child gets the checked pseudoclass added to it. \n"});
