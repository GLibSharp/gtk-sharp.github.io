It is often used as an alternative to a GtkProgressBar for displaying indefinite activity instead of actual progress. \nTo start the animation use gtk_spinner_start to stop it use gtk_spinner_stop. \nGtkSpinner has a single CSS node with the name spinner. When the animation is active the checked pseudoclass is added to this node. \n"});
