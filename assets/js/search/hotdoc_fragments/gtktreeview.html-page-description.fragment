These coordinates start at for row of the tree. \nSeveral functions are available for converting between the different coordinate systems. The most common translations are between widget and bin window coordinates and between bin window and tree coordinates. For the former you can use gtk_tree_view_convert_widget_to_bin_window_coords and vice versa for the latter gtk_tree_view_convert_bin_window_to_tree_coords and vice versa \nThe GtkTreeView implementation of the GtkBuildable interface accepts GtkTreeViewColumn objects as elements and exposes the internal GtkTreeSelection in UI definitions. \nAn example of a UI definition fragment with GtkTreeView \nGtkTreeView has a main CSS node with name treeview and style class view. It has a subnode with name header which is the parent for all the column header widgets CSS nodes. For rubberband selection a subnode with name rubberband is used. \n"});
