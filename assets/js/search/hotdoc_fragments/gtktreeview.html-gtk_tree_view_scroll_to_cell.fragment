If column is NULL then no horizontal scrolling occurs. Likewise if path is NULL no vertical scrolling occurs. At a minimum one of column or path need to be non NULL. row_align determines where the row is placed and col_align determines where column is placed. Both are expected to be between and means left top alignment means right bottom alignment means center. \nIf use_align is FALSE then the alignment arguments are ignored and the tree does the minimum amount of work to scroll the cell onto the screen. This means that the cell will be scrolled to the edge closest to its current position. If the cell is currently visible on the screen nothing is done. \nThis function only works if the model is set and path is a valid row on the model. If the model changes before the tree_view is realized the centered path will be modified to reflect this change. \nParameters \nA GtkTreeView. \nThe path of the row to move to or NULL. \nThe GtkTreeViewColumn to move horizontally to or NULL. \nwhether to use alignment arguments or FALSE. \nThe vertical alignment of the row specified by path. \nThe horizontal alignment of the column specified by column. \nMoves the alignments of tree_view to the position specified by column and path.
