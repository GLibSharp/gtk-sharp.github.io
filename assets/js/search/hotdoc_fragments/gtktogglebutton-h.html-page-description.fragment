Clicking again will cause the toggle button to return to its normal state. \nA toggle button is created by calling either gtk_toggle_button_new or gtk_toggle_button_new_with_label. If using the former it is advisable to pack a widget such as a GtkLabel and or a GtkImage into the toggle button s container. See GtkButton for more information \nThe state of a GtkToggleButton can be set specifically using gtk_toggle_button_set_active and retrieved using gtk_toggle_button_get_active. \nTo simply switch the state of a toggle button use gtk_toggle_button_toggled. \nGtkToggleButton has a single CSS node with name button. To differentiate it from a plain GtkButton it gets the toggle style class. \n"});
