fragment_downloaded_cb({"url": "gtkmain.html#page-description", "fragment": "Before using GTK you need to initialize it initialization connects to the window system display and parses some standard command line arguments. The gtk_init macro initializes GTK gtk_init exits the application if errors occur to avoid this use gtk_init_check. gtk_init_check allows you to recover from a failed GTK initialization you might start up your application in text mode instead. \nLike all GUI toolkits GTK uses an event driven programming model. When the user is doing nothing GTK sits in the main loop and waits for input. If the user performs some action say a mouse click then the main loop wakes up and delivers an event to GTK GTK forwards the event to one or more widgets. \nWhen widgets receive an event they frequently emit one or more signals Signals notify your program that something interesting happened by invoking functions you ve connected to the signal with g_signal_connect. Functions connected to a signal are often termed callbacks \nWhen your callbacks are invoked you would typically take some action for example when an Open button is clicked you might display a GtkFileChooserDialog. After a callback finishes GTK will return to the main loop and await more user input. \nIt s OK to use the GLib main loop directly instead of gtk_main though it involves slightly more typing. See GMainLoop in the GLib documentation. \n"});
