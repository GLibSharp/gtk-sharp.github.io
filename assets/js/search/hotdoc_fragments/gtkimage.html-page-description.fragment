fragment_downloaded_cb({"url": "gtkimage.html#page-description", "fragment": "The GtkImage widget displays an image. Various kinds of object can be displayed as an image most typically you would load a GdkPixbuf pixel buffer from a file and then display that. There s a convenience function to do this gtk_image_new_from_file used as follows \nIf the file isn t loaded successfully the image will contain a broken image icon similar to that used in many web browsers. If you want to handle errors in loading the file yourself for example by displaying an error message then load the image with gdk_pixbuf_new_from_file then create the GtkImage with gtk_image_new_from_pixbuf. \nThe image file may contain an animation if so the GtkImage will display an animation GdkPixbufAnimation instead of a static image. \nSometimes an application will want to avoid depending on external data files such as image files. GTK comes with a program to avoid this called gdk pixbuf csource This library allows you to convert an image into a C variable declaration which can then be loaded into a GdkPixbuf using gdk_pixbuf_new_from_inline. \nGtkImage has a single CSS node with the name image. \n"});
