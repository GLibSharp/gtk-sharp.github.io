A GtkMenuItem can have a submenu associated with it allowing for nested hierarchical menus. \nA menu item can be selected this means that it is displayed in the prelight state and if it has a submenu that submenu will be popped up. \nA menu is active when it is visible onscreen and the user is selecting from it. A menubar is not active until the user clicks on one of its menuitems. When a menu is active passing the mouse over a submenu will pop it up. \nThere is also a concept of the current menu and a current menu item. The current menu item is the selected menu item that is furthest down in the hierarchy. Every active menu shell does not necessarily contain a selected menu item but if it does then the parent menu shell must also contain a selected menu item. The current menu is the menu that contains the current menu item. It will always have a GTK grab and receive all key presses. \n"});
