Window managers are free to ignore this most window managers ignore requests for initial window positions instead using a user defined placement algorithm and honor requests after the window has already been shown. \nNote the position is the position of the gravity determined reference point for the window. The gravity determines two things first the location of the reference point in root window coordinates and second which point on the window is positioned at the reference point. \nBy default the gravity is Gdk.Gravity.NorthWest so the reference point is simply the x y supplied to Gtk.Window.Move. The top left corner of the window decorations aka window frame or border will be placed at x y. Therefore to position a window at the top left of the screen you want to use the default gravity which is Gdk.Gravity.NorthWest and move the window to \nTo position a window at the bottom right corner of the screen you would set Gdk.Gravity.SouthEast which means that the reference point is at x the window width and y the window height and the bottom right corner of the window border will be placed at that reference point. So to place a window in the bottom right corner you would first set gravity to south east then write gtk_window_move window gdk_screen_width window_width gdk_screen_height window_height note that this example does not take multi head scenarios into account \nThe Extended Window Manager Hints Specification has a nice table of gravities in the implementation notes section. \nThe Gtk.Window.GetPosition documentation may also be relevant. \nParameters \nX coordinate to move window to \nY coordinate to move window to \n"});
