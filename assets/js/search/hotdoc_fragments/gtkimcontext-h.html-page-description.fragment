fragment_downloaded_cb({"url": "gtkimcontext-h.html#page-description", "fragment": "GtkIMContext defines the interface for GTK input methods. An input method is used by GTK text input widgets like GtkEntry to map from key events to Unicode character strings. \nThe default input method can be set programmatically via the GtkSettings gtk im module GtkSettings property. Alternatively you may set the GTK_IM_MODULE environment variable as documented in Running GTK Applications gtk running \nThe GtkEntry GtkEntry im module and GtkTextView GtkTextView im module properties may also be used to set input methods for specific widget instances. For instance a certain entry widget might be expected to contain certain characters which would be easier to input with a certain input method. \nAn input method may consume multiple key events in sequence and finally output the composed result. This is called preediting and an input method may provide feedback about this process by displaying the intermediate composition states as preedit text. For instance the default GTK input method implements the input of arbitrary Unicode code points by holding down the Control and Shift keys and then typing U followed by the hexadecimal digits of the code point. When releasing the Control and Shift keys preediting ends and the character is inserted as text. Ctrl Shift u20AC for example results in the sign. \nAdditional input methods can be made available for use by GTK widgets as loadable modules. An input method module is a small shared library which implements a subclass of GtkIMContext or GtkIMContextSimple and exports these four functions \nThis function should register the GType of the GtkIMContext subclass which implements the input method by means of g_type_module_register_type. Note that g_type_register_static cannot be used as the type needs to be registered dynamically. \nHere goes any cleanup code your input method might require on module unload. \nThis function returns the list of input methods provided by the module. The example implementation above shows a common solution and simply returns a pointer to statically defined array of GtkIMContextInfo items for each provided input method. \nThis function should return a pointer to a newly created instance of the GtkIMContext subclass identified by context_id. The context ID is the same as specified in the GtkIMContextInfo array returned by im_module_list. \nAfter a new loadable input method module has been installed on the system the configuration file gtk.immodules needs to be regenerated by gtk query immodules gtk query immodules in order for the new input method to become available to GTK applications. \n"});
