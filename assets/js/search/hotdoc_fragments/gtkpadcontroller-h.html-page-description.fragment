Pad devices often divide buttons and sensors into groups all elements in a group share the same current mode but different groups may have different modes. See gdk_device_pad_get_n_groups and gdk_device_pad_get_group_n_modes. \nEach of the actions that a given button strip ring performs for a given mode is defined by GtkPadActionEntry it contains an action name that will be looked up in the given GActionGroup and activated whenever the specified input element and mode are triggered. \nA simple example of GtkPadController usage assigning button in all modes and pad devices to an invert selection action \nThe actions belonging to rings strips will be activated with a parameter of type G_VARIANT_TYPE_DOUBLE bearing the value of the given axis it is required that those are made stateful and accepting this GVariantType. \n"});
