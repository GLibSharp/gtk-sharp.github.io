fragment_downloaded_cb({"url": "gtkgrid-h.html#page-description", "fragment": "GtkGrid is a container which arranges its child widgets in rows and columns. It is a very similar to GtkBox but it consistently uses GtkWidget s margin and expand properties instead of custom child properties and it fully supports height for width geometry management geometry management \nChildren are added using gtk_grid_attach. They can span multiple rows or columns. It is also possible to add a child next to an existing child using gtk_grid_attach_next_to. The behaviour of GtkGrid when several children occupy the same grid cell is undefined. \nGtkGrid can be used like a GtkBox by just using gtk_container_add which will place children next to each other in the direction determined by the orientation property. \nGtkGrid uses a single CSS node with name grid. \n"});
