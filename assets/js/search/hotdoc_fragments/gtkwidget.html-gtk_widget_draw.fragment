The top left corner of the widget will be drawn to the currently set origin point of cr. \nYou should pass a cairo context as cr argument that is in an original state. Otherwise the resulting drawing is undefined. For example changing the operator using cairo_set_operator or the line width using cairo_set_line_width might have unwanted side effects. You may however change the context s transform matrix like with cairo_scale cairo_translate or cairo_set_matrix and clip region with cairo_clip prior to calling this function. Also it is fine to modify the context with cairo_save and cairo_push_group prior to calling this function. \nNote that special purpose widgets may contain special code for rendering to the screen and might appear differently on screen and when rendered using gtk_widget_draw. \nParameters \nthe widget to draw.
