Otherwise the source notebook will think that the dragged tab was removed from underneath the ongoing drag operation and will initiate a drag cancel animation. \nIf you want a notebook to accept drags from other widgets you will have to set your own DnD code to do it. \nParameters \na child Gtk.Widget \nwhether the tab is detachable or not \nSince \n"});
