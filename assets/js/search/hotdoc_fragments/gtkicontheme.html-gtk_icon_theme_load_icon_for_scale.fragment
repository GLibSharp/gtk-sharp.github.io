This is a convenience function if more details about the icon are needed use gtk_icon_theme_lookup_icon followed by gtk_icon_info_load_icon. \nNote that you probably want to listen for icon theme changes and update the icon. This is usually done by connecting to the GtkWidget style set signal. If for some reason you do not want to update the icon when the icon theme changes you should consider using gdk_pixbuf_copy to make a private copy of the pixbuf returned by this function. Otherwise GTK may need to keep the old icon theme loaded which would be a waste of memory. \nParameters \na GtkIconTheme \nthe name of the icon to lookup \nthe desired icon size.
