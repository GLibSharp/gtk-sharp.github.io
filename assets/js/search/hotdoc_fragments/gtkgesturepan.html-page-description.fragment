The axis that a GtkGesturePan handles is defined at construct time and can be changed through gtk_gesture_pan_set_orientation. \nWhen the gesture starts to be recognized GtkGesturePan will attempt to determine as early as possible whether the sequence is moving in the expected direction and denying the sequence if this does not happen. \nOnce a panning gesture along the expected axis is recognized the pan signal will be emitted as input events are received containing the offset in the given axis. \n"});
