This means that it must accept any value passed to its do_size_allocate function. \nWhen the parent allocates space to the scrollable child widget the widget should update the adjustments properties with new values. \nWhen any of the adjustments emits the value changed signal the scrollable widget should scroll its contents. \n"});
