This function will emit the event through all the hierarchy of widget through all propagation phases. \nEvents received by GTK from GDK normally begin in Gtk.Global.MainDoEvent. Depending on the type of event existence of modal dialogs grabs etc. the event may be propagated if so this function is used. \nGtk.Global.PropagateEvent calls Gtk.Widget.Event on each widget it decides to send the event to. So Gtk.Widget.Event is the lowest level function it simply emits the Event and possibly an event specific signal on a widget. Gtk.Global.PropagateEvent is a bit higher level and Gtk.Global.MainDoEvent is the highest level. \nAll that said you most likely don t want to use any of these functions synthesizing events is rarely needed. There are almost certainly better ways to achieve your goals. For example use Gtk.Widget.QueueDraw instead of making up expose events. \nParameters \na Gtk.Widget \nan event \n"});
