fragment_downloaded_cb({"url": "gtklinkbutton-h.html#page-description", "fragment": "A GtkLinkButton is a GtkButton with a hyperlink similar to the one used by web browsers which triggers an action when clicked. It is useful to show quick links to resources. \nA link button is created by calling either gtk_link_button_new or gtk_link_button_new_with_label. If using the former the URI you pass to the constructor is used as a label for the widget. \nThe URI bound to a GtkLinkButton can be set specifically using gtk_link_button_set_uri and retrieved using gtk_link_button_get_uri. \nBy default GtkLinkButton calls gtk_show_uri_on_window when the button is clicked. This behaviour can be overridden by connecting to the GtkLinkButton activate link signal and returning TRUE from the signal handler. \nGtkLinkButton has a single CSS node with name button. To differentiate it from a plain GtkButton it gets the link style class. \n"});
