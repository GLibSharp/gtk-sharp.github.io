Each item in the list is a detailed action name in the usual form. \nThis might be useful to discover if an accel already exists in order to prevent installation of a conflicting accelerator from an accelerator editor or a plugin system for example Note that having more than one action per accelerator may not be a bad thing and might make sense in cases where the actions never appear in the same context. \nIn case there are no actions for a given accelerator an empty array is returned. null is never returned. \nIt is a programmer error to pass an invalid accelerator string. If you are unsure check it with Gtk.Global.AcceleratorParse first. \nParameters \nan accelerator that can be parsed by Gtk.Global.AcceleratorParse \na null terminated array of actions for accel \nSince \n"});
