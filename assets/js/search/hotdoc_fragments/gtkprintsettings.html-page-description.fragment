fragment_downloaded_cb({"url": "gtkprintsettings.html#page-description", "fragment": "A GtkPrintSettings object represents the settings of a print dialog in a system independent way. The main use for this object is that once you ve printed you can get a settings object that represents the settings the user chose and the next time you print you can pass that object in so that the user doesn t have to re set all his settings. \nIts also possible to enumerate the settings so that you can easily save the settings for the next time your app runs or even store them in a document. The predefined keys try to use shared values as much as possible so that moving such a document between systems still works. \nPrinting support was added in GTK \n"});
