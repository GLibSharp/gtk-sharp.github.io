Cursor positions are unsurprisingly positions where the cursor can appear. Perhaps surprisingly there may not be a cursor position between all characters. The most common example for European languages would be a carriage return newline sequence. For some Unicode characters the equivalent of say the letter a with an accent mark will be represented as two characters first the letter then a combining mark that causes the accent to be rendered so the cursor can t go between those two characters. See also the Pango.LogAttr struct and Pango.Global.Break function. \ntrue if we moved and the new position is dereferenceable \n"});
