When implementing this virtual method it is safe to assume that context has already stored the aligned cell widths for every Gtk.TreeModel row that context will be allocated for since this information was stored at get_preferred_width time. This virtual method should also store any necessary alignments of cell heights for the case that the context is allocated a height. \nParameters \nCalculates the minimum and natural height for the area if the passed context would be allocated the given width.
