It is often temporarily shown at the top or bottom of a document. In contrast to GtkDialog which has a action area at the bottom GtkInfoBar has an action area at the side. \nThe API of GtkInfoBar is very similar to GtkDialog allowing you to add buttons to the action area with gtk_info_bar_add_button or gtk_info_bar_new_with_buttons. The sensitivity of action widgets can be controlled with gtk_info_bar_set_response_sensitive. To add widgets to the main content area of a GtkInfoBar use gtk_info_bar_get_content_area and add your widgets to the container. \nSimilar to GtkMessageDialog the contents of a GtkInfoBar can by classified as error message warning informational message etc by using gtk_info_bar_set_message_type. GTK may use the message type to determine how the message is displayed. \nA simple example for using a GtkInfoBar \nThe GtkInfoBar implementation of the GtkBuildable interface exposes the content area and action area as internal children with the names content_area and action_area \nGtkInfoBar supports a custom element which can contain multiple elements. The response attribute specifies a numeric response and the content of the element is the id of widget which should be a child of the dialogs action_area \nGtkInfoBar has a single CSS node with name infobar. The node may get one of the style classes info warning error or question depending on the message type. \n"});
