fragment_downloaded_cb({"url": "gtktextbuffer-h.html#gtk_text_buffer_get_slice", "fragment": "Gtk.TextBuffer.GetSlice \nReturns the text in the range start end Excludes undisplayed text text marked with tags that set the invisibility attribute if include_hidden_chars is false. The returned string includes a xFFFC character whenever the buffer contains embedded images so byte and character indexes into the returned string do correspond to byte and character indexes into the buffer. Contrast with Gtk.TextBuffer.GetText. Note that xFFFC can occur in normal text as well so it is not a reliable indicator that a pixbuf or widget is in the buffer. \nParameters \nstart of a range \nend of a range \nwhether to include invisible text \nan allocated UTF string \n"});
