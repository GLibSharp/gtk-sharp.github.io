Nearly always the type of the window should be Gtk.WindowType.Toplevel. If you re implementing something like a popup menu from scratch which is a bad idea just use Gtk.Menu you might use Gtk.WindowType.Popup. Gtk.WindowType.Popup is not for dialogs though in some other toolkits dialogs are called popups In GTK Gtk.WindowType.Popup means a pop up menu or pop up tooltip. On X11 popup windows are not controlled by the window manager gtk X11 arch \nIf you simply want an undecorated window no window borders use Gtk.Window.SetDecorated don t use Gtk.WindowType.Popup. \nAll top level windows created by Gtk.Window are stored in an internal top level window list. This list can be obtained from Gtk.Window.ListToplevels. Due to Gtk keeping a reference to the window internally Gtk.Window does not return a reference to the caller. \nTo delete a Gtk.Window call Gtk.Widget.Destroy. \nParameters \ntype of window \na new Gtk.Window. \n"});
