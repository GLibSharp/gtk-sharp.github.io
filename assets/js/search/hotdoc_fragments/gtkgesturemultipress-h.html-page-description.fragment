fragment_downloaded_cb({"url": "gtkgesturemultipress-h.html#page-description", "fragment": "GtkGestureMultiPress is a GtkGesture implementation able to recognize multiple clicks on a nearby zone which can be listened for through the GtkGestureMultiPress pressed signal. Whenever time or distance between clicks exceed the GTK defaults GtkGestureMultiPress stopped is emitted and the click counter is reset. \nCallers may also restrict the area that is considered valid for a touch button press through gtk_gesture_multi_press_set_area so any click happening outside that area is considered to be a first click of its own. \n"});
