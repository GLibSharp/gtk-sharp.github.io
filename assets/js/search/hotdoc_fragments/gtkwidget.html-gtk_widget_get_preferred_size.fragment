It can be used to deduce toplevel window and menu sizes as well as child widgets in free form containers such as GtkLayout. \nHandle with care. Note that the natural height of a height for width widget will generally be a smaller size than the minimum height since the required height for the natural width is generally smaller than the required height for the minimum width. \nUse gtk_widget_measure if you want to support baseline alignment. \nParameters \na GtkWidget instance \nlocation for storing the minimum size or NULL \nlocation for storing the natural size or NULL \nSince \nRetrieves the minimum and natural size of a widget taking into account the widget s preference for height for width management. \nThis is used to retrieve a suitable size by container widgets which do not impose any restrictions on the child placement.
