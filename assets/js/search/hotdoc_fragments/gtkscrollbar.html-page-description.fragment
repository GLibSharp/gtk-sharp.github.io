The self.props.page_size represents the size of the visible scrollable area. The fields self.props.step_increment and self.props.page_increment fields are added to or subtracted from the self.props.value when the user asks to move by a step using e.g. the cursor arrow keys or if present the stepper buttons or by a page using e.g. the Page Down Up keys \nGtkScrollbar has a main CSS node with name scrollbar and a subnode for its contents.
