If the accelerator map doesn t yet contain an entry for accel_path a new one is created. \nLocking an accelerator path prevents its accelerator from being changed during runtime. A locked accelerator path can be unlocked by Gtk.AccelMap.UnlockPath. Refer to Gtk.AccelMap.ChangeEntry for information about runtime accelerator changes. \nIf called more than once accel_path remains locked until Gtk.AccelMap.UnlockPath has been called an equivalent number of times. \nNote that locking of individual accelerator paths is independent from locking the Gtk.AccelGroup containing them. For runtime accelerator changes to be possible both the accelerator path and its Gtk.AccelGroup have to be unlocked. \nParameters \na valid accelerator path \nSince \n"});
