fragment_downloaded_cb({"url": "gtkspinbutton.html#page-description", "fragment": "A GtkSpinButton is an ideal way to allow the user to set the value of some attribute. Rather than having to directly type a number into a GtkEntry GtkSpinButton allows the user to click on one of two arrows to increment or decrement the displayed value. A value can still be typed in with the bonus that it can be checked to ensure it is in a given range. \nThe main properties of a GtkSpinButton are through an adjustment. See the GtkAdjustment section for more details about an adjustment s properties. Note that GtkSpinButton will by default make its entry large enough to accomodate the lower and upper bounds of the adjustment which can lead to surprising results. Best practice is to set both the self.props.width_chars and self.props.max_width_chars poperties to the desired number of characters to display in the entry. \nGtkSpinButtons main CSS node has the name spinbutton. It creates subnodes for the entry and the two buttons with these names. The button nodes have the style classes up and down. The GtkEntry subnodes if present are put below the entry node. The orientation of the spin button is reflected in the vertical or horizontal style class on the main node. \n"});
