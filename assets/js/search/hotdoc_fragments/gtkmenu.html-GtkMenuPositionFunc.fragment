The function sets the x and y parameters to the coordinates where the menu is to be drawn. To make the menu appear on a different monitor than the mouse pointer Gtk.Menu.set_monitor must be called. \nParameters \na Gtk.Menu. \naddress of the int representing the horizontal position where the menu shall be drawn. \naddress of the int representing the vertical position where the menu shall be drawn. This is an output parameter. \nthe data supplied by the user in the Gtk.Menu.popup data parameter. \nA user function supplied when calling gtk_menu_popup which controls the positioning of the menu when it is displayed. The function sets the x and y parameters to the coordinates where the menu is to be drawn. To make the menu appear on a different monitor than the mouse pointer gtk_menu_set_monitor must be called. \nParameters \na GtkMenu. \naddress of the gint representing the horizontal position where the menu shall be drawn. \naddress of the gint representing the vertical position where the menu shall be drawn. This is an output parameter. \nThis parameter controls how menus placed outside the monitor are handled. If this is set to TRUE and part of the menu is outside the monitor then GTK pushes the window into the visible area effectively modifying the popup position. Note that moving and possibly resizing the menu around will alter the scroll position to keep the menu items in place i.e. at the same monitor position they would have been without resizing. In practice this behavior is only useful for combobox popups or option menus and cannot be used to simply confine a menu to monitor boundaries. In that case changing the scroll offset is not desirable. \nthe data supplied by the user in the gtk_menu_popup data parameter. \nA user function supplied when calling Gtk.prototype.popup which controls the positioning of the menu when it is displayed. The function sets the x and y parameters to the coordinates where the menu is to be drawn. To make the menu appear on a different monitor than the mouse pointer Gtk.prototype.set_monitor must be called. \nParameters \na Gtk.Menu. \naddress of the Number representing the horizontal position where the menu shall be drawn. \naddress of the Number representing the vertical position where the menu shall be drawn. This is an output parameter. \nthe data supplied by the user in the Gtk.prototype.popup data parameter. \n"});
