It functions in a similar way to a cairo context and maintains a stack of render nodes and their associated transformations. \nThe node at the top of the stack is the the one that gtk_snapshot_append operates on. Use the gtk_snapshot_push and gtk_snapshot_pop functions to change the current node. \nThe only way to obtain a GtkSnapshot object is as an argument to the GtkWidget snapshot vfunc. \n"});
