fragment_downloaded_cb({"url": "gtkpopover-h.html#page-description", "fragment": "GtkPopover is a bubble like context window primarily meant to provide context dependent information or options. Popovers are attached to a widget passed at construction time on gtk_popover_new or updated afterwards through gtk_popover_set_relative_to by default they will point to the whole widget area although this behavior can be changed through gtk_popover_set_pointing_to. \nThe position of a popover relative to the widget it is attached to can also be changed through gtk_popover_set_position. \nBy default GtkPopover performs a GTK grab in order to ensure input events get redirected to it while it is shown and also so the popover is dismissed in the expected situations clicks outside the popover or the Esc key being pressed If no such modal behavior is desired on a popover gtk_popover_set_modal may be called on it to tweak its behavior. \nGtkPopover is often used to replace menus. To facilitate this it supports being populated from a GMenuModel using gtk_popover_new_from_model. In addition to all the regular menu model features this function supports rendering sections in the model in a more compact form as a row of icon buttons instead of menu items. \nTo use this rendering set the display hint attribute of the section to horizontal buttons and set the icons of your items with the verb icon attribute. \nThe contents child node always gets the background style class and it gets the menu style class if the popover is menu like e.g. GtkPopoverMenu or created using gtk_popover_new_from_model. \nParticular uses of GtkPopover such as touch selection popups or magnifiers in GtkEntry or GtkTextView get style classes like touch selection or magnifier to differentiate from plain popovers. \nWhen styling a popover directly the popover node should usually not have any background. \nNote that in order to accomplish appropriate arrow visuals GtkPopover uses custom drawing for the arrow node. This makes it possible for the arrow to change its shape dynamically but it also limits the possibilities of styling it using CSS. In particular the arrow gets drawn over the content node s border so they look like one shape which means that the border width of the content node and the arrow node should be the same. The arrow also does not support any border shape other than solid no border radius only one border width border bottom width is used and no box shadow. \n"});
