fragment_downloaded_cb({"url": "gtkpaned-h.html#page-description", "fragment": "GtkPaned has two panes arranged either horizontally or vertically. The division between the two panes is adjustable by the user by dragging a handle. \nChild widgets are added to the panes of the widget with gtk_paned_pack1 and gtk_paned_pack2. The division between the two children is set by default from the size requests of the children but it can be adjusted by the user. \nA paned widget draws a separator between the two child widgets and a small handle that the user can drag to adjust the division. It does not draw any relief around the children or around the separator. The space in which the separator is called the gutter. Often it is useful to put each child inside a GtkFrame with the shadow type set to GTK_SHADOW_IN so that the gutter appears as a ridge. No separator is drawn if one of the children is missing. \nEach child has two options that can be set resize and shrink. If resize is true then when the GtkPaned is resized that child will expand or shrink along with the paned widget. If shrink is true then that child can be made smaller than its requisition by the user. Setting shrink to FALSE allows the application to set a minimum size. If resize is false for both children then this is treated as if resize is true for both children. \nThe application can set the position of the slider as if it were set by the user by calling gtk_paned_set_position. \nGtkPaned has a main CSS node with name paned and a subnode for the separator with name separator. The subnode gets a wide style class when the paned is supposed to be wide. \nIn horizontal orientation the nodes of the children are always arranged from left to right. So first child will always select the leftmost child regardless of text direction. \n"});
