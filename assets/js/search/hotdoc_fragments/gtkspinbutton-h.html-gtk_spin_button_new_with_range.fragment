The value is initially set to the minimum value and a page increment of step is the default. The precision of the spin button is equivalent to the precision of step. \nNote that the way in which the precision is derived works best if step is a power of ten. If the resulting precision is not suitable for your needs use Gtk.SpinButton.SetDigits to correct it. \nParameters \nMinimum allowable value \nMaximum allowable value \nIncrement added or subtracted by spinning the widget \nThe new spin button as a Gtk.Widget \n"});
