Note that you shouldn t assume the window is definitely maximized afterward because other entities e.g. the user or window manager gtk X11 arch could unmaximize it again and not all window managers support maximization. But normally the window will end up maximized. Just don t write code that crashes if not. \nIt s permitted to call this function before showing a window in which case the window will be maximized when it appears onscreen initially. \nYou can track maximization via the window state event signal on Gtk.Widget or by listening to notifications on the IsMaximized property. \n"});
