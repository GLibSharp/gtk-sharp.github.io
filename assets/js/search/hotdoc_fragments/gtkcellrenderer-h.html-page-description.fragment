These objects are used primarily by the GtkTreeView widget though they aren t tied to them in any specific way. It is worth noting that GtkCellRenderer is not a GtkWidget and cannot be treated as such. \nThe primary use of a GtkCellRenderer is for drawing a certain graphical elements on a cairo_t. Typically one cell renderer is used to draw many cells on the screen. To this extent it isn t expected that a CellRenderer keep any permanent state around. Instead any state is set just prior to use using GObject property system. Then the cell is measured using gtk_cell_renderer_get_size. Finally the cell is rendered in the correct location using gtk_cell_renderer_snapshot. \nThere are a number of rules that must be followed when writing a new GtkCellRenderer. First and foremost it s important that a certain set of properties will always yield a cell renderer of the same size barring a GtkStyle change. The GtkCellRenderer also has a number of generic properties that are expected to be honored by all children. \nBeyond merely rendering a cell cell renderers can optionally provide active user interface elements. A cell renderer can be activatable like GtkCellRendererToggle which toggles when it gets activated by a mouse click or it can be editable like GtkCellRendererText which allows the user to edit the text using a GtkEntry. To make a cell renderer activatable or editable you have to implement the GtkCellRendererClass.activate or GtkCellRendererClass.start_editing virtual functions respectively. \nMany properties of GtkCellRenderer and its subclasses have a corresponding set property e.g. cell background set corresponds to cell background These set properties reflect whether a property has been set or not. You should not set them independently. \n"});
