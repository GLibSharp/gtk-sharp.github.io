This may mean raising the window in the stacking order deiconifying it moving it to the current desktop and or giving it the keyboard focus possibly dependent on the user s platform window manager and preferences. \nIf window is hidden this function calls Gtk.Widget.Show as well. \nThis function should be used when the user tries to open a window that s already open. Say for example the preferences dialog is currently open and the user chooses Preferences from the menu a second time use Gtk.Window.Present to move the already open dialog where the user can see it. \nIf you are calling this function in response to a user interaction it is preferable to use Gtk.Window.PresentWithTime. \n"});
