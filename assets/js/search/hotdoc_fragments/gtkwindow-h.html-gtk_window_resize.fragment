The default geometry constraint is that windows may not be smaller than their size request to override this constraint call Gtk.Widget.SetSizeRequest to set the window s request to a smaller value. \nIf Gtk.Window.Resize is called before showing a window for the first time it overrides any default size set with Gtk.Window.SetDefaultSize. \nWindows may not be resized smaller than by pixels. \nWhen using client side decorations GTK will do its best to adjust the given size so that the resulting window size matches the requested size without the title bar borders and shadows added for the client side decorations but there is no garantee that the result will be totally accurate because these widgets added for client side decorations depend on the theme and may not be realized or visible at the time Gtk.Window.Resize is issued. \nTypically Gtk.Window.Resize will compensate for the GtkHeaderBar height only if it s known at the time the resulting GtkWindow configuration is issued. For example if new widgets are added after the GtkWindow configuration and cause the GtkHeaderBar to grow in height this will result in a window content smaller that specified by Gtk.Window.Resize and not a larger window. \nParameters \nwidth in pixels to resize the window to \nheight in pixels to resize the window to \n"});
