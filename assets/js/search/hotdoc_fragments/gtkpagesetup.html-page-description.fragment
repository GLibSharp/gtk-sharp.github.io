fragment_downloaded_cb({"url": "gtkpagesetup.html#page-description", "fragment": "A GtkPageSetup object stores the page size orientation and margins. The idea is that you can get one of these from the page setup dialog and then pass it to the GtkPrintOperation when printing. The benefit of splitting this out of the GtkPrintSettings is that these affect the actual layout of the page and thus need to be set long before user prints. \nThe margins specified in this object are the print margins i.e. the parts of the page that the printer cannot print on. These are different from the layout margins that a word processor uses they are typically used to determine the minimal size for the layout margins. \nTo obtain a GtkPageSetup use gtk_page_setup_new to get the defaults or use gtk_print_run_page_setup_dialog to show the page setup dialog and receive the resulting page setup. \nPrinting support was added in GTK \n"});
