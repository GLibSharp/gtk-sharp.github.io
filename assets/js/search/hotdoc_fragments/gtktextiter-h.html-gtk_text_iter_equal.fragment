This function is very fast you can expect it to perform better than e.g. getting the character offset for each iterator and comparing the offsets yourself. Also it s a bit faster than Gtk.TextIter.Compare. \nParameters \nanother Gtk.TextIter \ntrue if the iterators point to the same place in the buffer \n"});
