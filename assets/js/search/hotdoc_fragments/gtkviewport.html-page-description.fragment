fragment_downloaded_cb({"url": "gtkviewport.html#page-description", "fragment": "The GtkViewport widget acts as an adaptor class implementing scrollability for child widgets that lack their own scrolling capabilities. Use GtkViewport to scroll child widgets such as GtkGrid GtkBox and so on. \nIf a widget has native scrolling abilities such as GtkTextView GtkTreeView or GtkIconView it can be added to a GtkScrolledWindow with gtk_container_add. If a widget does not you must first add the widget to a GtkViewport then add the viewport to the scrolled window. gtk_container_add does this automatically if a child that does not implement GtkScrollable is added to a GtkScrolledWindow so you can ignore the presence of the viewport. \nThe GtkViewport will start scrolling content only if allocated less than the child widget s minimum size in a given orientation. \nGtkViewport has a single CSS node with name viewport. \n"});
