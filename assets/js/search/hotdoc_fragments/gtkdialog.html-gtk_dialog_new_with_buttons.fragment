Button text can be arbitrary text. A response ID can be any positive number or one of the values in the GtkResponseType enumeration. If the user clicks one of these dialog buttons GtkDialog will emit the response signal with the corresponding response ID. If a GtkDialog receives the delete event signal it will emit response with a response ID of GTK_RESPONSE_DELETE_EVENT. However destroying a dialog does not emit the response signal so be careful relying on response when using the GTK_DIALOG_DESTROY_WITH_PARENT flag. Buttons are from left to right so the first button in the list will be the leftmost button in the dialog. \nHere s a simple example \nParameters \nTransient parent of the dialog or NULL \nfrom GtkDialogFlags \ntext to go in first button or NULL \nresponse ID for first button then additional buttons ending with NULL \na new GtkDialog \n"});
