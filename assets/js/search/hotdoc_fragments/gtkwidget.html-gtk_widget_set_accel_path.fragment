This removes any accelerators for any accelerator group installed by previous calls to gtk_widget_set_accel_path. Associating accelerators with paths allows them to be modified by the user and the modifications to be saved for future use. See gtk_accel_map_save. \nThis function is a low level function that would most likely be used by a menu creation system. \nIf you only want to set up accelerators on menu items gtk_menu_item_set_accel_path provides a somewhat more convenient interface. \nNote that accel_path string will be stored in a GQuark. Therefore if you pass a static string you can save some memory by interning it first with g_intern_static_string. \nParameters \na GtkWidget \npath used to look up the accelerator \na GtkAccelGroup. \nGiven an accelerator group accel_group and an accelerator path accel_path sets up an accelerator in accel_group so whenever the key binding that is defined for accel_path is pressed widget will be activated.
