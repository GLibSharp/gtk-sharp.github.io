The shortcuts can be grouped and you can have multiple sections in this window corresponding to the major modes of your application. \nAdditionally the shortcuts can be filtered by the current view to avoid showing information that is not relevant in the current application context. \nThe recommended way to construct a GtkShortcutsWindow is with GtkBuilder by populating a GtkShortcutsWindow with one or more GtkShortcutsSection objects which contain GtkShortcutsGroup that in turn contain objects of class GtkShortcutsShortcut. \n\nThis example has as single section. As you can see the shortcut groups are arranged in columns and spread across several pages if there are too many to find on a single page. \nThe ui file for this example can be found here. \n\nThis example shows a GtkShortcutsWindow that has been configured to show only the shortcuts relevant to the stopwatch view. \nThe ui file for this example can be found here. \n\nThis example shows a GtkShortcutsWindow with two sections Editor Shortcuts and Terminal Shortcuts \nThe ui file for this example can be found here. \n"});
