In particular drag and drop and GtkClipboard work via selections. You will very seldom or never need to use most of the functions in this section directly GtkClipboard provides a nicer interface to the same functionality. \nSome of the datatypes defined this section are used in the GtkClipboard and drag and drop API s as well. The GtkTargetEntry and GtkTargetList objects represent lists of data types that are supported when sending or receiving data. The GtkSelectionData object is used to store a chunk of data along with the data type and other associated information. \n"});
