fragment_downloaded_cb({"url": "gtkfilechooserbutton.html#page-description", "fragment": "The GtkFileChooserButton is a widget that lets the user select a file. It implements the GtkFileChooser interface. Visually it is a file name with a button to bring up a GtkFileChooserDialog. The user can then use that dialog to change the file associated with that button. This widget does not support setting the self.props.select_multiple property to TRUE. \nThe GtkFileChooserButton supports the GtkFileChooserAction GTK_FILE_CHOOSER_ACTION_OPEN and GTK_FILE_CHOOSER_ACTION_SELECT_FOLDER. \nThe GtkFileChooserButton will ellipsize the label and will thus request little horizontal space. To give the button more space you should call gtk_widget_get_preferred_size gtk_file_chooser_button_set_width_chars or pack the button in such a way that other interface elements give space to the widget. \n"});
