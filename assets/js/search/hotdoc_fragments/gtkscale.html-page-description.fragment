fragment_downloaded_cb({"url": "gtkscale.html#page-description", "fragment": "A GtkScale is a slider control used to select a numeric value. To use it you ll probably want to investigate the methods on its base class GtkRange in addition to the methods for GtkScale itself. To set the value of a scale you would normally use gtk_range_set_value. To detect changes to the value you would normally use the value changed signal. \nNote that using the same upper and lower bounds for the GtkScale through the GtkRange methods will hide the slider itself. This is useful for applications that want to show an undeterminate value on the scale without changing the layout of the application such as movie or music players \nGtkScale supports a custom element which can contain multiple elements. The value and position attributes have the same meaning as gtk_scale_add_mark parameters of the same name. If the element is not empty its content is taken as the markup to show at the mark. It can be translated with the usual translatable and context attributes. \nGtkScale has a main CSS node with name scale and a subnode for its contents with subnodes named trough and slider. \nThe main node gets the style class fine tune added when the scale is in fine tuning mode. \nIf the scale has an origin see gtk_scale_set_has_origin there is a subnode with name highlight below the trough node that is used for rendering the highlighted part of the trough. \nIf the scale is showing a fill level see gtk_range_set_show_fill_level there is a subnode with name fill below the trough node that is used for rendering the filled in part of the trough. \nIf marks are present there is a marks subnode before or after the trough node below which each mark gets a node with name mark. The marks nodes get either the top or bottom style class. \nThe mark node has a subnode named indicator. If the mark has text it also has a subnode named label. When the mark is either above or left of the scale the label subnode is the first when present. Otherwise the indicator subnode is the first. \nThe main CSS node gets the marks before and or marks after style classes added depending on what marks are present. \nIf the scale is displaying the value see draw value there is subnode with name value. \n"});
