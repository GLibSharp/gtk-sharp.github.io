Among other things you can choose on which edge the tabs appear see gtk_notebook_set_tab_pos whether if there are too many tabs to fit the notebook should be made bigger or scrolling arrows added see gtk_notebook_set_scrollable and whether there will be a popup menu allowing the users to switch pages. see gtk_notebook_popup_enable gtk_notebook_popup_disable \nThe GtkNotebook implementation of the GtkBuildable interface supports placing children into tabs by specifying tab as the type attribute of a element. Note that the content of the tab must be created before the tab can be filled. A tab child can be specified without specifying a type attribute. \nTo add a child widget in the notebooks action area specify action start or action end as the type attribute of the element. \nAn example of a UI definition fragment with GtkNotebook \nGtkNotebook has a main CSS node with name notebook a subnode with name header and below that a subnode with name tabs which contains one subnode per tab with name tab. \nIf action widgets are present their CSS nodes are placed next to the tabs node. If the notebook is scrollable CSS nodes with name arrow are placed as first and last child of the tabs node. \nThe main node gets the frame style class when the notebook has a border see gtk_notebook_set_show_border \nThe header node gets one of the style class top bottom left or right depending on where the tabs are placed. For reorderable pages the tab node gets the reorderable page class. \nA tab node gets the dnd style class while it is moved with drag and drop. \nThe nodes are always arranged from left to right regarldess of text direction. \n"});
