fragment_downloaded_cb({"url": "gtkactionable.html#page-description", "fragment": "This interface provides a convenient way of associating widgets with actions on a GtkApplicationWindow or GtkApplication. \nIt primarily consists of two properties action name and action target. There are also some convenience APIs for setting these properties. \nThe action will be looked up in action groups that are found among the widgets ancestors. Most commonly these will be the actions with the win. or app. prefix that are associated with the GtkApplicationWindow or GtkApplication but other action groups that are added with gtk_widget_insert_action_group will be consulted as well. \n"});
