fragment_downloaded_cb({"url": "gtksearchentry-h.html#page-description", "fragment": "GtkSearchEntry is a subclass of GtkEntry that has been tailored for use as a search entry. \nIt will show an inactive symbolic find icon when the search entry is empty and a symbolic clear icon when there is text. Clicking on the clear icon will empty the search entry. \nNote that the search clear icon is shown using a secondary icon and thus does not work if you are using the secondary icon position for some other purpose. \nTo make filtering appear more reactive it is a good idea to not react to every change in the entry text immediately but only after a short delay. To support this GtkSearchEntry emits the GtkSearchEntry search changed signal which can be used instead of the GtkEditable changed signal. \nThe GtkSearchEntry previous match GtkSearchEntry next match and GtkSearchEntry stop search signals can be used to implement moving between search results and ending the search. \nOften GtkSearchEntry will be fed events by means of being placed inside a GtkSearchBar. If that is not the case you can use gtk_search_entry_handle_event to pass events. \n"});
