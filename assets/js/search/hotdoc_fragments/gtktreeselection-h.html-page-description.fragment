fragment_downloaded_cb({"url": "gtktreeselection-h.html#page-description", "fragment": "The GtkTreeSelection object is a helper object to manage the selection for a GtkTreeView widget. The GtkTreeSelection object is automatically created when a new GtkTreeView widget is created and cannot exist independently of this widget. The primary reason the GtkTreeSelection objects exists is for cleanliness of code and API. That is there is no conceptual reason all these functions could not be methods on the GtkTreeView widget instead of a separate function. \nThe GtkTreeSelection object is gotten from a GtkTreeView by calling gtk_tree_view_get_selection. It can be manipulated to check the selection status of the tree as well as select and deselect individual rows. Selection is done completely view side. As a result multiple views of the same model can have completely different selections. Additionally you cannot change the selection of a row on the model that is not currently displayed by the view without expanding its parents first. \nOne of the important things to remember when monitoring the selection of a view is that the GtkTreeSelection changed signal is mostly a hint. That is it may only emit one signal when a range of rows is selected. Additionally it may on occasion emit a GtkTreeSelection changed signal when nothing has happened mostly as a result of programmers calling select_row on an already selected row \n"});
