fragment_downloaded_cb({"url": "gtkwidgetpath.html#page-description", "fragment": "GtkWidgetPath is a boxed type that represents a widget hierarchy from the topmost widget typically a toplevel to any child. This widget path abstraction is used in GtkStyleContext on behalf of the real widget in order to query style information. \nIf you are using GTK widgets you probably will not need to use this API directly as there is gtk_widget_get_path and the style context returned by gtk_widget_get_style_context will be automatically updated on widget hierarchy changes. \nThe widget path generation is generally simple \nAlthough more complex information such as widget names or different classes property that may be used by other widget types and intermediate regions may be included \nAll this information will be used to match the style information that applies to the described widget. \n"});
