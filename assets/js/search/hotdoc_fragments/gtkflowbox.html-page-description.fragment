Reducing the width in this case will require more rows so a larger height will be requested. \nLikewise with the vertical orientation the widgets will be arranged from top to bottom starting a new column to the right when necessary. Reducing the height will require more columns so a larger width will be requested. \nThe size request of a GtkFlowBox alone may not be what you expect if you need to be able to shrink it along both axes and dynamically reflow its children you may have to wrap it in a GtkScrolledWindow to enable that. \nThe children of a GtkFlowBox can be dynamically sorted and filtered. \nAlthough a GtkFlowBox must have only GtkFlowBoxChild children you can add any kind of widget to it via gtk_container_add and a GtkFlowBoxChild widget will automatically be inserted between the box and the widget. \nAlso see GtkListBox. \nGtkFlowBox was added in GTK \nGtkFlowBox uses a single CSS node with name flowbox. GtkFlowBoxChild uses a single CSS node with name flowboxchild. For rubberband selection a subnode with name rubberband is used. \n"});
