This function should only be called once per accel_path with the canonical accel_key and accel_mods for this path. To change the accelerator during runtime programatically use Gtk.AccelMap.ChangeEntry. \nSet accel_key and accel_mods to to request a removal of the accelerator. \nNote that accel_path string will be stored in a GLib.Quark. Therefore if you pass a static string you can save some memory by interning it first with GLib.Global.InternStaticString. \nParameters \nvalid accelerator path \nthe accelerator key \nthe accelerator modifiers \n"});
