If path isn t a valid path in model then null is returned. However unlike references created with Gtk.TreeRowReference it does not listen to the model for changes. The creator of the row reference must do this explicitly using Gtk.TreeRowReference.Inserted Gtk.TreeRowReference.Deleted gtk_tree_row_reference_reordered not introspectable \nThese functions must be called exactly once per proxy when the corresponding signal on the model is emitted. This single call updates all row references for that proxy. Since built in GTK objects like Gtk.TreeView already use this mechanism internally using them as the proxy object will produce unpredictable results. Further more passing the same object as model and proxy doesn t work for reasons of internal implementation. \nThis type of row reference is primarily meant by structures that need to carefully monitor exactly when a row reference updates itself and is not generally needed by most applications. \nParameters \na proxy GLib.Object \na Gtk.ITreeModel \na valid Gtk.TreePath struct to monitor \na newly allocated Gtk.TreeRowReference or null \n"});
