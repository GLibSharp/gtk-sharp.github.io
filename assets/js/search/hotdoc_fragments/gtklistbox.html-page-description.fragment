These rows can by dynamically sorted and filtered and headers can be added dynamically depending on the row content. It also allows keyboard and mouse navigation and selection like a typical list. \nUsing GtkListBox is often an alternative to GtkTreeView especially when the list contents has a more complicated layout than what is allowed by a GtkCellRenderer or when the contents is interactive i.e. has a button in it \nAlthough a GtkListBox must have only GtkListBoxRow children you can add any kind of widget to it via gtk_container_add and a GtkListBoxRow widget will automatically be inserted between the list and the widget. \nGtkListBoxRow can be marked as activatable or selectable. If a row is activatable row activated will be emitted for it when the user tries to activate it. If it is selectable the row will be marked as selected when the user tries to select it. \nThe GtkListBox widget was added in GTK \nGtkListBox uses a single CSS node named list. Each GtkListBoxRow uses a single CSS node named row. The row nodes get the activatable style class added when appropriate. \n"});
