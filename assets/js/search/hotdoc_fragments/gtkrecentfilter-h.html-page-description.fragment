Files can be filtered based on their name with gtk_recent_filter_add_pattern on their mime type with gtk_file_filter_add_mime_type on the application that has registered them with gtk_recent_filter_add_application or by a custom filter function with gtk_recent_filter_add_custom \nFiltering by mime type handles aliasing and subclassing of mime types e.g. a filter for text plain also matches a file with mime type application rtf since application rtf is a subclass of text plain. Note that GtkRecentFilter allows wildcards for the subtype of a mime type so you can e.g. filter for image \nNormally filters are used by adding them to a GtkRecentChooser see gtk_recent_chooser_add_filter but it is also possible to manually use a filter on a file with gtk_recent_filter_filter. \nRecently used files are supported since GTK \nThe GtkRecentFilter implementation of the GtkBuildable interface supports adding rules using the and elements and listing the rules within. Specifying a or has the same effect as calling gtk_recent_filter_add_mime_type gtk_recent_filter_add_pattern or gtk_recent_filter_add_application. \nAn example of a UI definition fragment specifying GtkRecentFilter rules \n"});
