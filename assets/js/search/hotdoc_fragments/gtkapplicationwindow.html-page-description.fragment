fragment_downloaded_cb({"url": "gtkapplicationwindow.html#page-description", "fragment": "GtkApplicationWindow is a GtkWindow subclass that offers some extra functionality for better integration with GtkApplication features. Notably it can handle both the application menu as well as the menubar. See gtk_application_set_app_menu and gtk_application_set_menubar. \nThis class implements the GActionGroup and GActionMap interfaces to let you add window specific actions that will be exported by the associated GtkApplication together with its application wide actions. Window specific actions are prefixed with the win. prefix and application wide actions are prefixed with the app. prefix. Actions must be addressed with the prefixed name when referring to them from a GMenuModel. \nNote that widgets that are placed inside a GtkApplicationWindow can also activate these actions if they implement the GtkActionable interface. \nAs with GtkApplication the GDK lock will be acquired when processing actions arriving from other processes and should therefore be held when activating actions locally if GDK threads are enabled \nThe settings gtk shell shows app menu and gtk shell shows menubar tell GTK whether the desktop environment is showing the application menu and menubar models outside the application as part of the desktop shell. For instance on OS X both menus will be displayed remotely on Windows neither will be. gnome shell starting with version will display the application menu but not the menubar. \nIf the desktop environment does not display the menubar then GtkApplicationWindow will automatically show a GtkMenuBar for it. This behaviour can be overridden with the show menubar property. If the desktop environment does not display the application menu then it will automatically be included in the menubar or in the windows client side decorations. \nA simple example \nThe XML format understood by GtkBuilder for GMenuModel consists of a toplevel menu element which contains one or more item elements. Each item element contains attribute and link elements with a mandatory name attribute. link elements have the same content model as menu Instead of link name submenu or link name section you can use submenu or section elements. \nAttribute values can be translated using gettext like other GtkBuilder content. attribute elements can be marked for translation with a translatable yes attribute. It is also possible to specify message context and translator comments using the context and comments attributes. To make use of this the GtkBuilder must have been given the gettext domain to use. \nThe following attributes are used when constructing menu items \nThe following attributes are used when constructing sections \nThe following attributes are used when constructing submenus \n"});
