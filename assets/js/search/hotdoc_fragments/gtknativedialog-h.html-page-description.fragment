fragment_downloaded_cb({"url": "gtknativedialog-h.html#page-description", "fragment": "Native dialogs are platform dialogs that don t use GtkDialog or GtkWindow. They are used in order to integrate better with a platform by looking the same as other native applications and supporting platform specific features. \nThe GtkDialog functions cannot be used on such objects but we need a similar API in order to drive them. The GtkNativeDialog object is an API that allows you to do this. It allows you to set various common properties on the dialog as well as show and hide it and get a GtkNativeDialog response signal when the user finished with the dialog. \nThere is also a gtk_native_dialog_run helper that makes it easy to run any native dialog in a modal way with a recursive mainloop similar to gtk_dialog_run. \n"});
