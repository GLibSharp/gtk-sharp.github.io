fragment_downloaded_cb({"url": "gtkiconview-h.html#page-description", "fragment": "GtkIconView provides an alternative view on a GtkTreeModel. It displays the model as a grid of icons with labels. Like GtkTreeView it allows to select one or multiple items depending on the selection mode see gtk_icon_view_set_selection_mode In addition to selection with the arrow keys GtkIconView supports rubberband selection which is controlled by dragging the pointer. \nNote that if the tree model is backed by an actual tree store as opposed to a flat list where the mapping to icons is obvious GtkIconView will only display the first level of the tree and ignore the tree s branches. \nGtkIconView has a single CSS node with name iconview and style class view. For rubberband selection a subnode with name rubberband is used. \n"});
