fragment_downloaded_cb({"url": "gtkglarea.html#page-description", "fragment": "GtkGLArea is a widget that allows drawing with OpenGL. \nGtkGLArea sets up its own GdkGLContext for the window it creates and creates a custom GL framebuffer that the widget will do GL rendering onto. It also ensures that this framebuffer is the default GL rendering target when rendering. \nIn order to draw you have to connect to the render signal or subclass GtkGLArea and override the GtkGLAreaClass.render virtual function. \nThe GtkGLArea widget ensures that the GdkGLContext is associated with the widget s drawing area and it is kept updated when the size and position of the drawing area changes. \nThe simplest way to draw using OpenGL commands in a GtkGLArea is to create a widget instance and connect to the render signal \nThe render function will be called when the GtkGLArea is ready for you to draw its content \nIf you need to initialize OpenGL state e.g. buffer objects or shaders you should use the realize signal you can use the unrealize signal to clean up. Since the GdkGLContext creation and initialization may fail you will need to check for errors using gtk_gl_area_get_error. An example of how to safely initialize the GL state is \nIf you need to change the options for creating the GdkGLContext you should use the create context signal. \n"});
