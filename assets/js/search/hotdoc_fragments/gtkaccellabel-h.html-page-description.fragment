fragment_downloaded_cb({"url": "gtkaccellabel-h.html#page-description", "fragment": "The GtkAccelLabel widget is a subclass of GtkLabel that also displays an accelerator key on the right of the label text e.g. Ctrl S It is commonly used in menus to show the keyboard short cuts for commands. \nThe accelerator key to display is typically not set explicitly although it can be with gtk_accel_label_set_accel Instead the GtkAccelLabel displays the accelerators which have been added to a particular widget. This widget is set by calling gtk_accel_label_set_accel_widget. \nFor example a GtkMenuItem widget may have an accelerator added to emit the activate signal when the Ctrl S key combination is pressed. A GtkAccelLabel is created and added to the GtkMenuItem and gtk_accel_label_set_accel_widget is called with the GtkMenuItem as the second argument. The GtkAccelLabel will now display Ctrl S after its label. \nNote that creating a GtkMenuItem with gtk_menu_item_new_with_label or one of the similar functions for GtkCheckMenuItem and GtkRadioMenuItem automatically adds a GtkAccelLabel to the GtkMenuItem and calls gtk_accel_label_set_accel_widget to set it up for you. \nA GtkAccelLabel will only display accelerators which have GTK_ACCEL_VISIBLE set see GtkAccelFlags A GtkAccelLabel can display multiple accelerators and even signal names though it is almost always used to display just one accelerator key. \nGtkAccelLabel has a main CSS node with the name accellabel. It adds a subnode with name label and another one with name accelerator. \n"});
