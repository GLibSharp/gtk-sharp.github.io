You can connect to the StatusChanged signal on op to obtain some information about the progress of the print operation. Furthermore it may use a recursive mainloop to show the print dialog. \nIf you call Gtk.PrintOperation.SetAllowAsync or set the AllowAsync property the operation will run asynchronously if this is supported on the platform. The Done signal will be emitted with the result of the operation when the it is done i.e. when the dialog is canceled or when the print succeeds or fails \nNote that Gtk.PrintOperation.Run can only be called once on a given Gtk.PrintOperation. \nParameters \nthe action to start \nTransient parent of the dialog \nthe result of the print operation. A return value of Gtk.PrintOperationResult.Apply indicates that the printing was completed successfully. In this case it is a good idea to obtain the used print settings with Gtk.PrintOperation.GetPrintSettings and store them for reuse with the next print operation. A value of Gtk.PrintOperationResult.InProgress means the operation is running asynchronously and will emit the Done signal when done. \nSince \n"});
