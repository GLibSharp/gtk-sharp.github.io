fragment_downloaded_cb({"url": "gtkaccessible.html#page-description", "fragment": "The GtkAccessible class is the base class for accessible implementations for GtkWidget subclasses. It is a thin wrapper around AtkObject which adds facilities for associating a widget with its accessible object. \nAn accessible implementation for a third party widget should derive from GtkAccessible and implement the suitable interfaces from ATK such as AtkText or AtkSelection. To establish the connection between the widget class and its corresponding acccessible implementation override the get_accessible vfunc in GtkWidgetClass. \n"});
