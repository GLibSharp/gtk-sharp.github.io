In the absence of an Xsettings manager GTK reads default values for settings from settings.ini files in etc gtk XDG_CONFIG_DIRS gtk and XDG_CONFIG_HOME gtk These files must be valid key files see GKeyFile and have a section called Settings. Themes can also provide default values for settings by installing a settings.ini file next to their gtk.css file. \nApplications can override system wide settings by setting the property of the GtkSettings object with g_object_set. This should be restricted to special cases though GtkSettings are not meant as an application configuration facility. When doing so you need to be aware that settings that are specific to individual widgets may not be available before the widget type has been realized at least once. The following example demonstrates a way to do this \nThere is one GtkSettings instance per screen. It can be obtained with gtk_settings_get_for_screen but in many cases it is more convenient to use gtk_widget_get_settings. gtk_settings_get_default returns the GtkSettings instance for the default screen. \n"});
