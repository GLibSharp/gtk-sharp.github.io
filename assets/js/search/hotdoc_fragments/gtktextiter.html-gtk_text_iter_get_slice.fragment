A slice is an array of characters encoded in UTF format including the Unicode unknown character xFFFC for iterable non character elements in the buffer such as images. Because images are encoded in the slice byte and character offsets in the returned array will correspond to byte offsets in the text buffer. Note that xFFFC can occur in normal text as well so it is not a reliable indicator that a pixbuf or widget is in the buffer. \nParameters \niterator at start of a range \niterator at end of a range \nslice of text from the buffer \nReturns the text in the given range.
