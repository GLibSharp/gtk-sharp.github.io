GIO has a concept of recommended and fallback applications for a given content type. Recommended applications are those that claim to handle the content type itself while fallback also includes applications that handle a more generic content type. GIO also knows the default and last used application for a given content type. The GtkAppChooserWidget provides detailed control over whether the shown list of applications should include default recommended or fallback applications. \nTo obtain the application that has been selected in a GtkAppChooser use gtk_app_chooser_get_app_info. \n"});
