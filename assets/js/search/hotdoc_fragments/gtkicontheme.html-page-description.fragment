fragment_downloaded_cb({"url": "gtkicontheme.html#page-description", "fragment": "GtkIconTheme provides a facility for looking up icons by name and size. The main reason for using a name rather than simply providing a filename is to allow different icons to be used depending on what icon theme is selected by the user. The operation of icon themes on Linux and Unix follows the Icon Theme Specification There is a fallback icon theme named hicolor where applications should install their icons but additional icon themes can be installed as operating system vendors and users choose. \nIn many cases named themes are used indirectly via GtkImage rather than directly but looking up icons directly is also simple. The GtkIconTheme object acts as a database of all the icons in the current theme. You can create new GtkIconTheme objects but it s much more efficient to use the standard icon theme for the GdkScreen so that the icon information is shared with other people looking up icons. \n"});
