fragment_downloaded_cb({"url": "gtkbox.html#page-description", "fragment": "The GtkBox widget organizes child widgets into a rectangular area. \nThe rectangular area of a GtkBox is organized into either a single row or a single column of child widgets depending upon the orientation. Thus all children of a GtkBox are allocated one dimension in common which is the height of a row or the width of a column. \nGtkBox uses a notion of packing. Packing refers to adding widgets with reference to a particular position in a GtkContainer. For a GtkBox there are two reference positions the start and the end of the box. For a vertical GtkBox the start is defined as the top of the box and the end is defined as the bottom. For a horizontal GtkBox the start is defined as the left side and the end is defined as the right side. \nUse repeated calls to gtk_box_pack_start to pack widgets into a GtkBox from start to end. Use gtk_box_pack_end to add widgets from end to start. You may intersperse these calls and add widgets from both ends of the same GtkBox. \nBecause GtkBox is a GtkContainer you may also use gtk_container_add to insert widgets into the box. Use gtk_container_remove to remove widgets from the GtkBox. \nUse gtk_box_set_homogeneous to specify whether or not all children of the GtkBox are forced to get the same amount of space. \nUse gtk_box_set_spacing to determine how much space will be minimally placed between all children in the GtkBox. Note that spacing is added between the children. \nUse gtk_box_reorder_child to move a GtkBox child to a different place in the box. \nNote that a single row or single column GtkGrid provides exactly the same functionality as GtkBox. \nGtkBox uses a single CSS node with name box. \nIn horizontal orientation the nodes of the children are always arranged from left to right. So first child will always select the leftmost child regardless of text direction. \n"});
