Gestures are by default isolated in their own groups. \nWhen gestures are grouped the state of Gdk.EventSequence is kept in sync for all of those so calling Gtk.Gesture.SetSequenceState on one will transfer the same value to the others. \nGroups also perform an implicit grabbing of sequences if a Gdk.EventSequence state is set to Gtk.EventSequenceState.Claimed on one group every other gesture group attached to the same Gtk.Widget will switch the state for that sequence to Gtk.EventSequenceState.Denied. \nParameters \na Gtk.Gesture \nSince \n"});
