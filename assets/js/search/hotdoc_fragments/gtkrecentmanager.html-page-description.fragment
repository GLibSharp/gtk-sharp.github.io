Each recently used file is identified by its URI and has meta data associated to it like the names and command lines of the applications that have registered it the number of time each application has registered the same file the mime type of the file and whether the file should be displayed only by the applications that have registered it. \nThe recently used files list is per user. \nThe GtkRecentManager acts like a database of all the recently used files. You can create new GtkRecentManager objects but it is more efficient to use the default manager created by GTK \nAdding a new recently used file is as simple as \nThe GtkRecentManager will try to gather all the needed information from the file itself through GIO. \nLooking up the meta data associated with a recently used file given its URI requires calling gtk_recent_manager_lookup_item \nIn order to retrieve the list of recently used files you can use gtk_recent_manager_get_items which returns a list of GtkRecentInfo structs. \nA GtkRecentManager is the model used to populate the contents of one or more GtkRecentChooser implementations. \nNote that the maximum age of the recently used files list is controllable through the gtk recent files max age property. \nRecently used files are supported since GTK \n"});
