        <h1 id="overview-of-gtk-input-and-event-handling">Overview of GTK+ input and event handling</h1>
<p>This chapter describes in detail how GTK+ handles input. If you are
interested in what happens to translate a key press or mouse motion of
the users into a change of a GTK+ widget, you should read this chapter.
This knowledge will also be useful if you decide to implement your own
widgets.</p>
<h2 id="devices-and-events">Devices and events</h2>
<p>The most basic input devices that every computer user has interacted
with are keyboards and mice; beyond these, GTK+ supports touchpads,
touchscreens and more exotic input devices such as graphics tablets.
Inside GTK+, every such input device is represented by a #GdkDevice
object.</p>
<p>To simplify dealing with the variability between these input devices,
GTK+ has a concept of master and slave devices. The concrete physical
devices that have many different characteristics (mice may have 2 or 3
or 8 buttons, keyboards have different layouts and may or may not have a
separate number block, etc) are represented as slave devices. Each slave
device is associated with a virtual master device. Master devices always
come in pointer/keyboard pairs - you can think of such a pair as a
'seat'.</p>
<p>GTK+ widgets generally deal with the master devices, and thus can be
used with any pointing device or keyboard.</p>
<p>When a user interacts with an input device (e.g. moves a mouse or
presses a key on the keyboard), GTK+ receives events from the windowing
system. These are typically directed at a specific window - for pointer
events, the window under the pointer (grabs complicate this), for
keyboard events, the window with the keyboard focus.</p>
<p>GDK translates these raw windowing system events into #GdkEvents.
Typical input events are: #GdkEventButton, #GdkEventMotion,
#GdkEventCrossing, #GdkEventKey, #GdkEventFocus, #GdkEventTouch</p>
<p>Additionally, GDK/GTK synthesizes other signals to let know whether
grabs (system-wide or in-app) are taking input away:
#GdkEventGrabBroken, #GtkWidget::grab-notify</p>
<p>When GTK+ is initialized, it sets up an event handler function with
gdk_event_handler_set(), which receives all of these input events (as
well as others, for instance window management related events).</p>
<h2 id="event-propagation">Event propagation</h2>
<p>For widgets which have a #GdkWindow set, events are received from the
windowing system and passed to gtk_main_do_event(). See its
documentation for details of what it does: compression of enter/leave
events, identification of the widget receiving the event, pushing the
event onto a stack for gtk_get_current_event(), and propagating the
event to the widget.</p>
<p>When a GDK backend produces an input event, it is tied to a #GdkDevice
and a #GdkWindow, which in turn represents a windowing system surface
in the backend. If a widget has grabbed the current input device, or all
input devices, the event is propagated to that #GtkWidget. Otherwise,
it is propagated to the the #GtkWidget which called
gtk_widget_register_window() on the #GdkWindow receiving the event.</p>
<p>Grabs are implemented for each input device, and globally. A grab for a
specific input device (gtk_device_grab_add()), is sent events in
preference to a global grab (gtk_grab_add()). Input grabs only have
effect within the #GtkWindowGroup containing the #GtkWidget which
registered the event’s #GdkWindow. If this #GtkWidget is a child of
the grab widget, the event is propagated to the child — this is the
basis for propagating events within modal dialogs.</p>
<p>An event is propagated to a widget using gtk_propagate_event().
Propagation differs between event types: key events (%GDK_KEY_PRESS,
%GDK_KEY_RELEASE) are delivered to the top-level #GtkWindow; other
events are propagated down and up the widget hierarchy in three phases
(see #GtkPropagationPhase).</p>
<p>For key events, the top-level window’s default
#GtkWindow::key-press-event and #GtkWindow::key-release-event signal
handlers handle mnemonics and accelerators first. Other key presses are
then passed to gtk_window_propagate_key_event() which propagates the
event upwards from the window’s current focus widget
(gtk_window_get_focus()) to the top-level.</p>
<p>For other events, in the first phase (the “capture” phase) the event is
delivered to each widget from the top-most (for example, the top-level
#GtkWindow or grab widget) down to the target #GtkWidget.
<a href="input-handling.html#event-controllers-and-gestures">Gestures</a> that
are attached with %GTK_PHASE_CAPTURE get a chance to react to the
event.</p>
<p>After the “capture” phase, the widget that was intended to be the
destination of the event will run gestures attached to it with
%GTK_PHASE_TARGET. This is known as the “target” phase, and only
happens on that widget.</p>
<p>Next, the #GtkWidget::event signal is emitted, then the appropriate
signal for the event in question, for example
#GtkWidget::motion-notify-event. Handling these signals was the primary
way to handle input in GTK+ widgets before gestures were introduced. If
the widget is realized, the #GtkWidget::event-after signal is emitted.
The signals are emitted from the target widget up to the top-level, as
part of the “bubble” phase.</p>
<p>The default handlers for the event signals send the event to gestures
that are attached with %GTK_PHASE_BUBBLE. Therefore, gestures in the
“bubble” phase are only used if the widget does not have its own event
handlers, or takes care to chain up to the default #GtkWidget handlers.</p>
<p>Events are not delivered to a widget which is insensitive or unmapped.</p>
<p>Any time during the propagation phase, a widget may indicate that a
received event was consumed and propagation should therefore be stopped.
In traditional event handlers, this is hinted by returning
%GDK_EVENT_STOP. If gestures are used, this may happen when the widget
tells the gesture to claim the event touch sequence (or the pointer
events) for its own. See the "gesture states" section below to know more
of the latter.</p>
<h2 id="event-masks">Event masks</h2>
<p>Each widget instance has a basic event mask and another per input
device, which determine the types of input event it receives. Each event
mask set on a widget is added to the corresponding (basic or per-device)
event mask for the widget’s #GdkWindow, and all child #GdkWindows.</p>
<p>Filtering events against event masks happens inside #GdkWindow, which
exposes event masks to the windowing system to reduce the number of
events GDK receives from it. On receiving an event, it is filtered
against the #GdkWindow’s mask for the input device, if set. Otherwise,
it is filtered against the #GdkWindow’s basic event mask.</p>
<p>This means that widgets must add to the event mask for each event type
they expect to receive, using gtk_widget_set_events() or
gtk_widget_add_events() to preserve the existing mask. Widgets which
are aware of floating devices should use
gtk_widget_set_device_events() or
gtk_widget_add_device_events(), and must explicitly enable the
device using gtk_widget_set_device_enabled(). See the
#GdkDeviceManager documentation for more information.</p>
<p>All standard widgets set the event mask for all events they expect to
receive, and it is not necessary to modify this. Masks should be set
when implementing a new widget.</p>
<h2 id="touch-events">Touch events</h2>
<p>Touch events are emitted as events of type %GDK_TOUCH_BEGIN,
%GDK_TOUCH_UPDATE or %GDK_TOUCH_END, those events contain an “event
sequence” that univocally identifies the physical touch until it is
lifted from the device.</p>
<p>On some windowing platforms, multitouch devices perform pointer
emulation, this works by granting a “pointer emulating” hint to one of
the currently interacting touch sequences, which will be reported on
every #GdkEventTouch event from that sequence. By default, if a widget
didn't request touch events by setting %GDK_TOUCH_MASK on its event
mask and didn't override #GtkWidget::touch-event, GTK+ will transform
these “pointer emulating” events into semantically similar
#GdkEventButton and #GdkEventMotion events. Depending on
%GDK_TOUCH_MASK being in the event mask or not, non-pointer-emulating
sequences could still trigger gestures or just get filtered out,
regardless of the widget not handling those directly.</p>
<p>If the widget sets %GDK_TOUCH_MASK on its event mask and doesn't chain
up on #GtkWidget::touch-event, only touch events will be received, and
no pointer emulation will be performed.</p>
<h2 id="grabs">Grabs</h2>
<p>Grabs are a method to claim all input events from a device, they happen
either implicitly on pointer and touch devices, or explicitly. Implicit
grabs happen on user interaction, when a #GdkEventButtonPress happens,
all events from then on, until after the corresponding
#GdkEventButtonRelease, will be reported to the widget that got the
first event. Likewise, on touch events, every #GdkEventSequence will
deliver only events to the widget that received its %GDK_TOUCH_BEGIN
event.</p>
<p>Explicit grabs happen programatically (both activation and
deactivation), and can be either system-wide (GDK grabs) or
application-wide (GTK grabs). On the windowing platforms that support
it, GDK grabs will prevent any interaction with any other
application/window/widget than the grabbing one, whereas GTK grabs will
be effective only within the application (across all its windows), still
allowing for interaction with other applications.</p>
<p>But one important aspect of grabs is that they may potentially happen at
any point somewhere else, even while the pointer/touch device is already
grabbed. This makes it necessary for widgets to handle the cancellation
of any ongoing interaction. Depending on whether a GTK or GDK grab is
causing this, the widget will respectively receive a
#GtkWidget::grab-notify signal, or a #GdkEventGrabBroken event.</p>
<p>On gestures, these signals are handled automatically, causing the
gesture to cancel all tracked pointer/touch events, and signal the end
of recognition.</p>
<h2 id="keyboard-input">Keyboard input</h2>
<h2 id="event-controllers-and-gestures">Event controllers and gestures</h2>
<p>Event controllers are standalone objects that can perform specific
actions upon received #GdkEvents. These are tied to a #GtkWidget, and
can be told of the event propagation phase at which they will manage the
events.</p>
<p>Gestures are a set of specific controllers that are prepared to handle
pointer and/or touch events, each gestures implementation attempts to
recognize specific actions out the received events, notifying of the
state/progress accordingly to let the widget react to those. On
multi-touch gestures, every interacting touch sequence will be tracked
independently.</p>
<p>Being gestures “simple” units, it is not uncommon to tie several
together to perform higher level actions, grouped gestures handle the
same event sequences simultaneously, and those sequences share a same
state across all grouped gestures. Some examples of grouping may be: A
“drag” and a “swipe” gestures may want grouping. The former will
report events as the dragging happens, the latter will tell the swipe
X/Y velocities only after gesture has finished., Grouping a “drag”
gesture with a “pan” gesture will only effectively allow dragging in the
panning orientation, as both gestures share state., If “press” and “long
press” are wanted simultaneously, those would need grouping.</p>
<h2 id="gesture-states">Gesture states</h2>
<p>Gestures have a notion of “state” for each individual touch sequence.
When events from a touch sequence are first received, the touch sequence
will have “none” state, this means the touch sequence is being handled
by the gesture to possibly trigger actions, but the event propagation
will not be stopped.</p>
<p>When the gesture enters recognition, or at a later point in time, the
widget may choose to claim the touch sequences (individually or as a
group), hence stopping event propagation after the event is run through
every gesture in that widget and propagation phase. Anytime this
happens, the touch sequences are cancelled downwards the propagation
chain, to let these know that no further events will be sent.</p>
<p>Alternatively, or at a later point in time, the widget may choose to
deny the touch sequences, thus letting those go through again in event
propagation. When this happens in the capture phase, and if there are no
other claiming gestures in the widget, a
%GDK_TOUCH_BEGIN/%GDK_BUTTON_PRESS event will be emulated and
propagated downwards, in order to preserve consistency.</p>
<p>Grouped gestures always share the same state for a given touch sequence,
so setting the state on one does transfer the state to the others. They
also are mutually exclusive, within a widget there may be only one
gesture group claiming a given sequence. If another gesture group claims
later that same sequence, the first group will deny the sequence.</p>
